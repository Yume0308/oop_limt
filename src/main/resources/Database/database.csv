Carlotta R. Anderson,Hardcover,"""All-American Anarchist"" chronicles the life and work of Joseph A. Labadie (1850-1933), Detroit's prominent labor organizer and one of early labor's most influential activists. A dynamic participant in the major social reform movements of the Gilded Age, Labadie was a central figure in the pervasive struggle for a new social order as the American Midwest underwent rapid industrialization at the end of the 19th century. This engaging biography follows Labadie's colorful career from a childhood among a Pottawatomi tribe in the Michigan woods through his local and national involvement in a maze of late 19th-century labor and reform activities, including participation in the Socialist Labor party, Knights of Labor, Greenback movement, trades councils, typographical union, eight-hour-day campaigns, and the rise of the American Federation of Labor. In writing this biography of her grandfather, Carlotta R. Anderson consulted the renowned Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan, a unique collection of protest literature which extensively documents pivotal times in American labor history and radical history.","Labor,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356461214l/1001079.jpg,814327079,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001079.All_American_Anarchist,324,All-American Anarchist: Joseph A.

Jeffrey Pfeffer,Hardcover,"Why is common sense so uncommon when it comes to managing people? How is it that so many seemingly intelligent organizations implement harmful management practices and ideas? In his provocative new book, ,The Human Equation,, bestselling author Jeffrey Pfeffer examines why much of the current conventional wisdom is wrong and asks us to re-think the way managers link people with organizational performance. Pfeffer masterfully builds a powerful business case for managing people effectivelyâ€”not just because it makes for good corporate policy, but because it results in outstanding performance and profits. Challenging current thinking and practice, Pfeffer: reveals the costs of downsizing and provides alternatives; identifies troubling trends in compensation, and suggests better practices; explains why even the smartest managers sometimes manage people unwisely; demonstrates how market-based forces can fail to create good people management practices, creating a need for positive public policy; and provides practical guidelines for implementing high-performance management practices. Filled with information and ideas, ,The Human Equation, provides much-needed guidance for managing people more wisely and more profitably.","Business,Leadership,Romance,Historical Romance,Nonfiction,Business,Management,Management,Human Resources",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400939083l/1001090.jpg,875848419,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001090.The_Human_Equation,368,The Human Equation: Building Profits by Putting People First,67
Jeffrey Pfeffer,Paperback,"""Competitive Advantage Through People"" explores why - despite long-standing evidence that a committed work force is essential for success - firms continue to attach little importance to their workers. The answer, argues Pfeffer, resides in a complex web of factors based on perception, history, legislation, and practice that continues to dominate management thought and action. Yet, some organizations have been able to overcome these obstacles. In fact, the five common stocks with the highest returns between 1972 and 1992 - Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, Circuit City, and Plenum Publishing - were in industries that shared virtually none of the characteristics traditionally associated with strategic success. What each of these firms did share is the ability to produce sustainable competitive advantage through its way of managing people. Pfeffer documents how they - and others - resisted traditional management pitfalls, and offers frameworks for implementing these changes in any industry.","Business,Leadership,Business,Management,Romance,Historical Romance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387741596l/1001092.jpg,087584717X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001092.Competitive_Advantage_Through_People,304,Competitive Advantage Through People: Unleashing the Power of the Work Force,87

Brian   Morris,Paperback,"In this important, scholarly and wide-ranging text, Brian Morris provides a lucid outline of the nature of the explanations of religious phenomena offered by such great thinkers as Hegel, Marx, and Weber. In doing so he also unravels the many theoretical strategies in the study of religion that have been developed and explored by later anthropologists. Besides discussing the classical authors and the debates surrounding their work, Morris presents perceptive accounts of more contemporary scholars such as Jung, Malinowski, Levi-Strauss, Geertz, and Godelier.

Richard Layard,Paperback,"There is a paradox at the heart of our lives. We all want more money, but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. This is not speculation: It's the story told by countless pieces of scientific research. We now have sophisticated ways of measuring how happy people are, and all the evidence shows that on average people have grown no happier in the last fifty years, even as average incomes have more than doubled.The central question the great economist Richard Layard asks in ,Happiness, is this: If we really wanted to be happier, what would we do differently? First we'd have to see clearly what conditions generate happiness and then bend all our efforts toward producing them. That is what this book is about-the causes of happiness and the means we have to effect it.,Until recently there was too little evidence to give a good answer to this essential question, but, Layard shows us, thanks to the integrated insights of psychology, sociology, applied economics, and other fields, we can now reach some firm conclusions, conclusions that will surprise you. ,Happiness, is an illuminating road map, grounded in hard research, to a better, happier life for us all.","Psychology,Nonfiction,Economics,Science,Philosophy,Self Help,Self Help,Personal Development,Sociology,Writing,Journalism,Politics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309287208l/100120.jpg,143037013,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100120.Happiness,320,Happiness: Lessons from a New Science,14
Philip Mansel,Hardcover,"Throughout history rulers have used clothes as a form of legitimization and propaganda. While palaces, pictures, and jewels might reflect the choice of a monarchâ€™s predecessors or advisers, clothes reflected the preferences of the monarch himself. Being both personal and visible, the right costume at the right time could transform and define a monarchâ€™s reputation. Many royal leaders have known this, from Louis XIV to Catherine the Great and from Napoleon I to Princess Diana.,This intriguing book explores how rulers have sought to control their image through their appearance. Mansel shows how individual styles of dress throw light on the personalities of particular monarchs, on their court system, and on their ambitions. The book looks also at the economics of the costume industry, at patronage, at the etiquette involved in mourning dress, and at the act of dressing itself. Fascinating glimpses into the lives of European monarchs and contemporary potentates reveal the intimate connection between power and the way it is packaged.","History,Couture,Fashion,Nonfiction,Historical,Cultural,France",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328871490l/1001221.jpg,300106971,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001221.Dressed_to_Rule,256,Dressed to Rule: Royal and Court Costume from Louis XIV to Elizabeth II,100

"Christopher Peterson,Martin E.P. Seligman",Hardcover,"Character has become a front-and-center topic in contemporary discourse, but this term does not have a fixed meaning. Character may be simply defined by what someone does not do, but a more active and thorough definition is necessary, one that addresses certain vital questions. Is character a singular characteristic of an individual, or is it composed of different aspects? Does character--however we define it--exist in degrees, or is it simply something one happens to have? How can character be developed? Can it be learned? Relatedly, can it be taught, and who might be the most effective teacher? What roles are played by family, schools, the media, religion, and the larger culture? This groundbreaking handbook of character strengths and virtues is the first progress report from a prestigious group of researchers who have undertaken the systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. They approach good character in terms of separate strengths-authenticity, persistence, kindness, gratitude, hope, humor, and so on-each of which exists in degrees.,Character Strengths and Virtues, classifies twenty-four specific strengths under six broad virtues that consistently emerge across history and culture: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Each strength is thoroughly examined in its own chapter, with special attention to its meaning, explanation, measurement, causes, correlates, consequences, and development across the life span, as well as to strategies for its deliberate cultivation. This book demands the attention of anyone interested in psychology and what it can teach about the good life.","Psychology,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Reference,Self Help,Personal Development,Self Help,Parenting,Education,Business,Psychology,Counselling",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348620946l/100130.jpg,195167015,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100130.Character_Strengths_and_Virtues,800,Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification,136

Mifflin's delight in books and authors is infectious--with his singular philosophy and bright eyes, he comes to represent the heart and soul of the book world. But a certain spirited spinster, disgruntled with her life, may have a hand in changing all that.

"Fernando Henrique Cardoso,Brian Winter",Paperback,"Fernando Henrique Cardoso received a phone call in the middle of the night asking him to be the new Finance Minister of Brazil. As he put the phone down and stared into the darkness of his hotel room, he feared he'd been handed a political death sentence. The year was 1993, and he would be responsible for an economy that had had seven different currencies in the previous eight years to cope with inflation that had run at 3000 percent a year. Brazil had a habit of chewing up finance ministers with the ferocity of an Amazon piranha. This was just one of the turns in a largely unscripted and sometimes unwanted political career. In exile during the harshest period of the junta that ruled Brazil for twenty years, Cardoso started his political life with a tentative run for the Federal Senate in 1978. Within fifteen years, and despite himself, this former sociologist was running the country.,And what a country! Brazil, it is often said, is on the edge of modernity, striding with one foot in mid-air towards the future, the other still rooted deep in a traditional past. It is a land of sophisticated music and brutal gold-digging, of the next global superpower and the last old-time coffee plantations. It is gloriously ungovernable, irrepressibly attractive, and home to the family, friends and extraordinary life of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. This is his story and his love song to his country.","History,Cultural,Brazil,Nonfiction,Biography,Politics,Autobiography,Memoir,Economics,Culture,Society",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437014640l/1001322._SY475_.jpg,1586483242,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001322.The_Accidental_President_of_Brazil,291,The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir,116
Gustavo Gorriti,Paperback,"First published in Peru in 1990, ,The Shining Path, was immediately hailed as one of the finest works on the insurgency that plagued that nation for over fifteen years. A richly detailed and absorbing account, it covers the dramatic years between the guerrillas' opening attack in 1980 and President Fernando Belaunde's reluctant decision to send in the military to contain the growing rebellion in late 1982. Covering the strategy, actions, successes, and setbacks of both the government and the rebels, the book shows how the tightly organized insurgency forced itself upon an unwilling society just after the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime.,One of Peru's most distinguished journalists, Gustavo Gorriti first covered the Shining Path movement for the leading Peruvian newsweekly, ,Caretas,. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and an impressive array of government and Shining Path documents, he weaves his careful research into a vivid portrait of the now-jailed Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman, Belaunde and his generals, and the unfolding drama of the fiercest war fought on Peruvian soil since the Chilean invasion a century before.","History,Nonfiction,Politics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348583091l/1001325.jpg,807846767,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001325.The_Shining_Path,318,The Shining Path: A History of the Millenarian War in Peru,22
Robert J. Shiller,Paperback,"As Robert Shillerâ€™s new 2009 preface to his prescient classic on behavioral economics and market volatility asserts, the irrational exuberance of the stock and housing markets â€œhas been ended by an economic crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.â€ As we all, ordinary Americans and professional investors alike, crawl from the wreckage of our heedless bubble economy, the shrewd insights and sober warnings, and hard facts that Shiller marshals in this book are more invaluable than ever. ,The original and bestselling 2000 edition of Irrational Exuberance evoked Alan Greenspanâ€™s infamous 1996 use of that phrase to explain the alternately soaring and declining stock market. It predicted the collapse of the tech stock bubble through an analysis of the structural, cultural, and psychological factors behind levels of price growth not reflected in any other sector of the economy. In the second edition (2005), Shiller folded real estate into his analysis of market volatility, marshalling evidence that housing prices were dangerously inflated as well, a bubble that could soon burst, leading to a â€œstring of bankruptciesâ€ and a â€œworldwide recession.â€ That indeed came to pass, with consequences that the 2009 preface to this edition deals with. ,Irrational Exuberance is more than ever a cogent, chilling, and astonishingly far-seeing analytical work that no one with any money in any market anywhere can afford not to readâ€“and heed.","Economics,Economics,Finance,Business,Nonfiction,Psychology,Currency,Money,History,Finance,Personal Finance,Science,Philosophy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384376065l/100132.jpg,767923634,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100132.Irrational_Exuberance,304,Irrational Exuberance,2

B. Mark Smith,Paperback,"The stock market is big news today. Over 50 percent of the American public own stocks directly or indirectly, meaning that the financial well-being of tens of millions of people is directly tied to the market. Alan Greenspan has stated that it is not possible to understand the modern economy without understanding the stock market. But this has not always been so. ,Many people now alive can remember a very different time, when the stock market was little more than a primitive insiders' game, viewed by most Americans with skepticism and suspicion. In ,Toward Rational Exuberance,, B. Mark Smith, a professional stock trader with two decades of practical experience, tells the story of how this stunning transformation occurred. It is a fascinating story, involving colorful personalities, dramatic events, and revolutionary new ideas. In the course of the narrative, Smith traces the evolution of popular theories of stock market behavior, showing how they have greatly influenced the way the investing public views the market. But he also shows how some of these theories are based on faulty interpretations of market history that may lead investors astray.

"Carly Mine,Carly Mine",Paperback,"When adult entertainment first appeared on the pop culture radar as an underground film phenomenon, women were little more than starlets, whoâ€”for the most partâ€”answered to men. But as pornography evolved in step with technology and consumer demand over the past twenty years, it also reflected the shifting political climate. Greater sexual equality started to appear both in front of and behind the cameras. Not only did female performers take charge for the first time of their careers, but women began running the companies people purchase movies from, opening woman-friendly sex shops and writing thoughtful, analytical commentary on pornography-often from a feminist perspective.,In ,Naked Ambition,, adult entertainment industry insider Carly Milne takes readers behind the scenes and on to the frontlines of today's woman-owned and supported adult entertainment industry that has revolutionized both pornography and the traditional feminist movement that has for years often stood in opposition to it. Personal essays by Jenna Jameson, Theresa Flynt, Violet Blue, Holly Randall, Tristan Taormino, Tera Patrick, Danni Ashe, Nina Hartley, Jane Duvall and Rachel Kramer Bussel, among other top women pornographers and pornography supporters showcase this relatively recent but fast-growing segment of adult entertainment producers and consumers.","Nonfiction,Sociology,Sexuality,Sex Work,Feminism,Sexuality,Gender,GLBT,Queer",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348423970l/1001379.jpg,786715901,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001379.Naked_Ambition,340,Naked Ambition: Women Who Are Changing Pornography,122
Martin Evans,Hardcover,"Invaded in 1830, populated by one million settlers who co-existed uneasily with nine million Arabs and Berbers, Algeria was different from other French colonies because it was administered as an integral part of France, in theory no different from Normandy or Brittany. The depth and scale of the colonization process explains why the Algerian War of 1954 to 1962 was one of the longest and most violent of the decolonization struggles.,An undeclared war in the sense that there was no formal beginning of hostilities, the war produced huge tensions that brought down four governments, ended the Fourth Republic in 1958, and mired the French army in accusations of torture and mass human rights abuses. In carefully re-examining the origins and consequences of the conflict, Martin Evans argues that it was the Socialist led Republican Front, in power from January 1956 until May 1957, which was the defining moment in the war. Predicated on the belief in the universal civilizing mission of the Fourth Republic, coupled with the conviction that Algerian nationalism was feudal and religiously fanatical in character, the Republican Front dramatically intensified the war in the spring of 1956.,Drawing upon previously classified archival sources as well as new oral testimonies, this book underlines the conflict of values between the Republican Front and Algerian nationalism, explaining how this clash produced patterns of thought and action, such as the institutionalization of torture and the raising of pro-French Muslim militias, which tragically polarized choices and framed all subsequent stages of the conflict.","History,Cultural,Africa,Northern Africa,Algeria,Cultural,France,Nonfiction,Religion,Islam,Military,Military History,Africa,Northern Africa",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348010302l/10013840.jpg,192803506,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10013840-algeria,457,Algeria: France's Undeclared War,70
Jerome Murphy-O'Connor,Paperback,"For someone who has exercised such a profound influence on Christian theology, Paul remains a shadowy figure behind the barrier of his complicated and difficult biblical letters. Debates about his meaning have deflected attention from his personality, yet his personality is an important key to understanding his theological ideas. This book redresses the balance. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's disciplined imagination, nourished by a lifetime of research, shapes numerous textual, historical, and archaeological details into a colourful and enjoyable story of which Paul is the flawed but undefeated hero., This chronological narrative offers new insights into Paul's intellectual, emotional, and religious development and puts his travels, mission, and theological ideas into a plausible biographical context. As he changes from an assimilated Jewish teenager in Tarsus to a competitive Pharisee in Jerusalem and then to a driven missionary of Christ, the sometimes contradictory components of Paul's complex personality emerge from the way he interacts with people and problems. His theology was forged in dialogue and becomes more intelligible as our appreciation of his person deepens. In Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's engaging biography, the Apostle comes to life as a complex, intensely human individual.","Religion,Religion,Theology,Christianity,New Testament",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348064280l/1001384.jpg,199283842,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001384.Paul,259,Paul: His Story,17

Janice G. Raymond,Paperback,"Fifteen years ago, when it was first published, ""The Transsexual Empire"" challenged the medical psychiatric definition of transsexualism as a disease and sex conversion hormones and surgery as the cure. It exposed the antifeminist stereotyping that requires candidates for transsexual surgery to prove themselves by conforming to subjective, outdated and questionable feminine roles and ""passing"" as women. Then as now, defining and treating transsexualism as a medical problem prevents the person experiencing so-called gender dissatisfaction from seeing it in a gender-challenging or feminist framework. Transsexualism goes to the question of what gender is, how to challenge it, and what reinforces gender stereotyping in a role-defined society. In the new introduction to this feminist work, Raymond discusses how these same issues are now debated in the context of transgender. Transgenderism reduces gender resistance to wardrobes, hormones, surgery and posturing - anything but real sexual equality. It assimilates the roles and definitions of masculinity and femininity, often mixing and matching, but never really moving beyond both.,In a similar way, transsexualism is thought to be a radical challenge to gender roles, breaking the boundaries of gender and transgressing its rigid lines. But if the transsexual merely exchanges one gender role for another, and if the outcome of such a sex reassignment is to endorse a femininity which, in many transsexuals, becomes a caricature of much that feminists have rejected about many-made femininity, then where is the challenge, the transgression, and the breaking of any real boundaries? This book will be used as a text in women's studies, psychology, sociology, technology and public policy, as well as by medical students, law students, and all who have an interest in feminist issues.","Feminism,Nonfiction,Gender,GLBT,Queer,LGBT,LGBT,Transgender,Psychology,Philosophy,Politics,Social",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346281085l/1001441.jpg,807762725,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001441.The_Transsexual_Empire,264,The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male,28

Jaiya John,Paperback,"July 15, 1968. It is only three months following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the nation is burning. Black and White America are locked in the tense grip of massive change. Into this inferno steps an unsuspecting young White couple. Neither had truly known even a single African American person while growing up. Now, a child will change all of that forever. In this fateful moment, a Black baby becomes perhaps the first in the history of New Mexico to be adopted by a White family. Here is a brazenly honest glimpse into the mind and heart of that child, a true story for the ages that flows like a soulful river-separated from his mother at birth, placed into foster care, adopted, and finally reunited with his biological family in adulthood-an astounding journey of personal discovery. Jaiya John has opened the floodgates on his own childhood with this piercing memoir. Black Baby White Hands, a waterfall of jazz splashing over the rocks of love, pain and the honoring of family.

Based on his suggestions and spiritual science, generations of farmers, gardeners, viticulturist, and researchers developed biodynamics as a healing, nurturing, holistic, ecological, organic, and spiritual approach to a sustainable care of the Earth.,Biodynamic methods consider the farm or garden to be a self-contained organism, embedded in the living landscape of the Earth, which is in turn part of a living, dynamic cosmos of vital, spiritual energies. The aim is to increase the health and vitality of the whole, including the farmer or gardener. The biodynamic practitioner follows an alchemical, transformative path of working with the Earth through the nine ""homeopathic"" preparations created by Steiner.,What Is Biodynamics?, collects seven seminal lectures--four on developing a spiritual perception of nature and three from his ,

Robert Drews,Paperback,"The Bronze Age came to a close early in the twelfth century b.c. with one of the worst calamities in history: over a period of several decades, destruction descended upon key cities throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, bringing to an end the Levantine, Hittite, Trojan, and Mycenaean kingdoms and plunging some lands into a dark age that would last more than four hundred years. In his attempt to account for this destruction, Robert Drews rejects the traditional explanations and proposes a military one instead.","History,Nonfiction,History,Ancient History,War,Literature,Ancient,History,Archaeology,Classics,War,Military Fiction,Cultural,Greece,Reference,Research",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387664154l/1001744.jpg,691025916,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001744.The_End_of_the_Bronze_Age,264,The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C.,48

She takes the reader through the mental preparation, coaching strategies, and personal struggles of players--who are part Rocky and part Rambo. If you like to read, you'll love ""Ain't No Tomorrow,"""",--Sylvester Stallone. .,At the start of the 2000 NBA playoffs, the famously underachieving Los Angeles Lakers found themselves the focus of national attention. The team that had limped along since the golden era of Magic Johnson was now endowed with basketball's two most gifted and dominant players, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, and was led by none other than Phil Jackson, the most fabled coach in the NBA. By the time the Lakers beat Indiana in game six of the championship series, they showed themselves unstoppable, a team above and apart and blessed with a glamour and facility that made them the obvious franchise to lead pro basketball into the new millennium.. .,Then everything began to fall apart. Jackson had warned his team that the truly challenging season is the one ""after ""an initial big win, and his words were quickly becoming reality as the great team slipped into profound disarray at the start of the new season. ""Ain't No Tomorrow ""is an intimate look at the astonishing eight-month roller-coaster ride that became the Lakers' 2000-2001 season: a time of tumult and drama when impulses toward brotherhood and unity dissolved into petty, uglybattles and bruised egos; when men who previously rose to a great challenge grew greedy and slack.. .,Combining brilliant reporting and original perspective, Elizabeth Kaye--a journalist granted special access to Jackson, Shaq, Kobe, and other major players--takes you into the minds and hearts of the team members. She chronicles the unique story of a team that ultimately righted itself, united, and found its way to a second championship title--but only after an extraordinary season in which exciting sports drama becomes human drama at its most compelling and complex..","Sports,Sports,Sports,Basketball",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180127253l/1001856.jpg,71387366,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001856.Ain_t_No_Tomorrow,256,Ain't No Tomorrow,34

RoxAnn Klugman,Hardcover,"In 1944 Anne Scheiber, a lifelong federal employee whose income never surpassed $3,150 a year -- yes, the figure is correct! -- invested $5,000 in blue-chip stocks. When she died in 1995 her stocks were worth $22 million -- that figure is also correct! -- and she was receiving an annual income of over $1 million in dividends from them. The Dividend Growth Investment Strategy tells how she did it and how others can invest long-term in stock for retirement income.Over half of all Americans have money in the stock market, most of it in mutual funds. But most mutual funds underperform the stock market, and they are taxed. The taxes and fees destroy compounding of investments and diminish the retirement nest egg. Anne Scheiber's method, the Dividend Growth Investment Strategy (DGIS), beats the mutual fund in returns fivefold after thirty years, though both approaches achieve 14 percent annual growth.,This book examines and compares the various investment strategies of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds and shows in hard figures why DGIS is the better investment strategy. The DGIS maximizes growth of the nest egg while producing income that doubles every five years. It also minimizes anxiety over market downturns and inflation because investors can ride the market ""roller coaster"" by keeping their capital growing, while riding the stock market ""escalator"" through dividend growth returns, all the while avoiding taxes on their dividends.,To help the investor choose stocks, company fundamentals are discussed along with suggestions on how to research them and what materials to use.","Economics,Finance,Finance,Personal Finance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347623881l/1001916.jpg,806521821,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001916.The_Dividend_Growth_Investment_Strategy,290,The Dividend Growth Investment Strategy: How to Keep Your Retirement Income Doubling Every Five Years,25

Eithne Quinn,Paperback,"In the late 1980s, gangsta rap music emerged in urban America, giving voice to--and making money for--a social group widely considered to be in crisis: young, poor, black men. From its local origins, gangsta rap went on to flood the mainstream, generating enormous popularity and profits. Yet the highly charged lyrics, public battles, and hard, fast lifestyles that characterize the genre have incited the anger of many public figures and proponents of ""family values."" Constantly engaging questions of black identity and race relations, poverty and wealth, gangsta rap represents one of the most profound influences on pop culture in the last thirty years.,Focusing on the artists Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, the Geto Boys, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur, Quinn explores the origins, development, and immense appeal of gangsta rap. Including detailed readings in urban geography, neoconservative politics, subcultural formations, black cultural debates, and music industry conditions, this book explains how and why this music genre emerged. In ,Nuthin'but a ""G"" Thang,, Quinn argues that gangsta rap both reflected and reinforced the decline in black protest culture and the great rise in individualist and entrepreneurial thinking that took place in the U.S. after the 1970s. Uncovering gangsta rap's deep roots in black working-class expressive culture, she stresses the music's aesthetic pleasures and complexities that have often been ignored in critical accounts.","Music,Music,Hip Hop",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348110069l/1001929.jpg,231124090,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001929.Nuthin_But_a_G_Thang,251,"Nuthin' But a ""G"" Thang: The Culture and Commerce of Gangsta Rap",121

Mantak Chia,Paperback,"A guide to nourishing the body through bone marrow rejuvenation exercises ,â€¢ Presents exercises to â€œregrowâ€ bone marrow, revive the internal organs, and prevent osteoporosis ,â€¢ Explains the use of bone breathing and bone compression, â€œhittingâ€ to detoxify the body, and sexual energy massage and chi weight lifting to enhance the life force within ,Most Westerners believe that a daily physical exercise program helps slow the aging process. Yet those whose bodies appear most physically fit on the outside often enjoy only the same life span as the average nonathletic person. It is the internal organs and glands that nourish every function of the body, and it is the bone marrow that nourishes and rejuvenates the organs and glands through the production of blood. By focusing only on the muscles without cultivating the internal organs, bones, and blood, the Western fitness regimen can ultimately exhaust the internal system. ,In ,Bone Marrow Nei Kung, Master Mantak Chia reveals the ancient mental and physical Taoist techniques used to â€œregrowâ€ bone marrow, strengthen the bones, and rejuvenate the organs and glands. An advanced practice of Iron Shirt Chi Kung, Bone Marrow Nei Kung was developed as a way to attain the â€œsteel bodyâ€ coveted in the fields of Chinese medicine and martial arts. This method of absorbing energy into the bones revives the bone marrow and reverses the effects of aging through the techniques of bone breathing, bone compression, and sexual energy massage, which stimulates the hormonal production that helps prevent osteoporosis. Also included is extensive information on chi weight lifting and the practice of â€œhittingâ€ to detoxify the body.","Combat,Martial Arts,Religion,Taoism,Spirituality",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391972906l/100206.jpg,159477112X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100206.Bone_Marrow_Nei_Kung,272,Bone Marrow Nei Kung: Taoist Techniques for Rejuvenating the Blood and Bone,24

Joe Klein,Paperback,"Perhaps now best known as an acclaimed (and bestselling) author of fiction, Joe Klein has for nearly three decades been one of contemporary journalism's premiere reporters. In ""Woody Guthrie: A Life"", Klein's signature style of insightful narrative nonfiction brings to life a vivid chapter in the history of American culture.,In 1998, the Woody Guthrie Foundation made public for the first time more than 10,000 of his papers, letters, song lyrics, and artworks, sparking renewed interest in the life of an American folk legend who influenced generations of musicians to come. The New York Times, reporting on the phenomenon, described Guthrie's appeal and legacy succinctly: ""(Woody Guthrie was) one of the most influential cultural figures of the century. Guthrie inspired Bob Dylan and virtually created the modern folk tradition and singer-songwriter genre, and his music remains as vital today as when he was performing"".,Born in Oklahoma in 1912, Guthrie spent his early years among the farmers and migrant workers of the dust bowl. As a young man during the Great Depression, he traveled across the country by boxcar with his guitar, composing the indelible folk ballads that made him a leader of the politically vital folk movement of the pre-war era. Tragically, the onset of Huntington's disease, gradually diminished his mind, body, and work, and led to his untimely death at the age of 55. Still, Guthrie's life and music have inspired every important folk and folk rock artist since, from Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez to Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, and Ani DiFranco.","Music,Biography,Nonfiction,History,Biography Memoir,Reference,Research,Adventure,Folklore,Autobiography,Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417406926l/100213.jpg,385333854,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100213.Woody_Guthrie,512,Woody Guthrie,132

Andrew Bradstock,Paperback,"""The present state of the old world is running up like parchment in the fire."" So declaimed Gerrard Winstanley, charismatic leader of radical religious group the Diggers, in mid-seventeenth century England: one of the most turbulent periods in that country's history. As three civil wars divided and slaughtered families and communities, as failing harvests and land reforms forced many to the edge of starvation, and as longstanding institutions like the House of Lords, the Established Church and even the monarchy were unceremoniously dismantled, so a feverish sense of living on the cusp of a new age gripped the nation. ,Radical Religion in Cromwell's England, is the first genuinely concise and accessible history of the fascinating ideas and popular movements which emerged during this volatile period. Names like the ""Ranters,"" ""Seekers,""Â ""Diggers,"" ""Muggletonians"" and ""Levellers"" convey something of the exoticism of these associations, which although loose-knit, and in some cases short-lived, impacted on every stratum of society. Andrew Bradstock critically appraises each group and its ideas, taking into account the context in which they emerged, the factors which influenced them, and their significance at the time and subsequently. The role of political, religious, economic and military factors in shaping radical opinion is explored in full, as is the neglected contribution of women to these movements. Drawing on the author's long study of the topic, ,Radical Religion in Cromwell's England, brings a remarkable era to vivid and colorful life.",History,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1315694755l/10022889.jpg,1845117654,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10022889-radical-religion-in-cromwell-s-england,224,Radical Religion in Cromwell's England: A Concise History from the English Civil War to the End of the Commonwealth,124

Stephen C. Levinson,Paperback,"This is the first extended discussion of preferred interpretation in language understanding, integrating much of the best research in linguistic pragmatics from the last two decades.,When we speak, we mean more than we say. In this book Stephen C. Levinson explains some general processes that underlie presumptions in communication. This is the first extended discussion of preferred interpretation in language understanding, integrating much of the best research in linguistic pragmatics from the last two decades. Levinson outlines a theory of presumptive meanings, or preferred interpretations, governing the use of language, building on the idea of implicature developed by the philosopher H.P. Grice. Some of the indirect information carried by speech is presumed by default because it is carried by general principles, rather than inferred from specific assumptions about intention and context. Levinson examines this class of general pragmatic inferences in detail, showing how they apply to a wide range of linguistic constructions. This approach has radical consequences for how we think about language and communication.","Humanities,Linguistics,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347512848l/1002385.jpg,262621304,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002385.Presumptive_Meanings,504,Presumptive Meanings: The Theory of Generalized Conversational Implicature,24

"Maria Manzano,Samson Abramsky,C.J. van Rijsbergen",Paperback,"Classical logic has proved inadequate in various areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, philosopy and linguistics. This is an introduction to extensions of first-order logic, based on the principle that many-sorted logic (MSL) provides a unifying framework in which to place, for example, second-order logic, type theory, modal and dynamic logics and MSL itself. The aim is two fold: only one theorem-prover is needed; proofs of the metaproperties of the different existing calculi can be avoided by borrowing them from MSL. To make the book accessible to readers from different disciplines, whilst maintaining precision, the author has supplied detailed step-by-step proofs, avoiding difficult arguments, and continually motivating the material with examples. Consequently this can be used as a reference, for self-teaching or for first-year graduate courses.","Philosophy,Logic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348959040l/10024102.jpg,521019028,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10024102-extensions-of-first-order-logic,412,Extensions of First-Order Logic,66

The in-depth focus on applications separates this book from others, and helps students to see how linear algebra can be applied to real-life situations. Some of the more contemporary topics of applied linear algebra are included here which are not normally found in undergraduate textbooks. Theoretical developments are always accompanied with detailed examples, and each section ends with a number of exercises from which students can gain further insight. Moreover, the inclusion of historical information provides personal insights into the mathematicians who developed this subject.

Pauline Matarasso,Hardcover,"Queen's Mate tells the story of three remarkable women who shaped and presided over the destiny of France during the last years of the 15th century and the early part of the 16th: Anne of France, Anne of Brittany, and Louise of Savoy. Although each is worthy of her own individual biography, their lives were so enmeshed by kinship, marriage and circumstances as to be well served by a book that mirrors the complex interweaving of their lives. Their story is rich enough in dramatic incident to provide a gripping narrative, but the book looks also at the wider issues: at the restrictions, particularly in the exercise of power, placed on the three women by society; at their success in ignoring or pushing back those barriers; at what they wanted or expected for their daughters; and at how they saw themselves in relation to men. The study draws largely on contemporary sources, both printed and manuscript, and presents material hitherto unknown or overlooked. It is the first study of the three women as a group, and indeed is one of the first modern, reliable studies in English or French of any one of them as an individual.","Cultural,France,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560869010l/1002467._SY475_.jpg,754603210,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002467.Queen_s_Mate,332,Queen's Mate: Three Women of Power in France on the Eve of the Renaissance,62

"Abraham von Worms,S.L. MacGregor Mathers",Paperback,"Around the turn of the century, when ,Aleister Crowley, was working out his system of Magick, the source that he turned to for basics was the system of Abramelin of Egypt. From Abramelin he took his concepts of protections, purifications, evocations, vestments, and dromena down to specific details. This system of Abramelin the Mage is known from a unique 15th century manuscript persevered in the Bibliotheque de l`Arsenal in Paris. In it, Abraham of Wurzburg, a cabalist and connoisseur of magics, describes a tour that he made of the then civilized world, visiting sorcerers, magicians, and cabalists, estimating their powers and virtues. This quest is in itself as fascinating as the similar tours of ,Gurdjieff,. The high point of Abraham`s travels was found in a small town on the banks of the Nile, where he encountered the great magician Abramelin, whose complete system Abraham thereupon sets out in detail. This amounts to a complete course in ceremonial magic (both white and black), which the student can pursue by himself. Abramelin, whose system is based mostly on Hellenistic theurgy of the ,Iamblichan, sort, but with Jewish increments from the Cabala, explains the qualifications needed to become a magician, purifications and asceticisms to be practiced month by month, studies and activities permitted during this period, selections of place and time for working magic, equipment needed, prayers and formulas, evocation of good and evil spirits, commanding spirits, to do one`s will, overcoming rebellious spirits, an similar material. Specific instructions are offered to develop such powers as clairvoyance, divining metals and treasurers, warding off evil magic, healing illness, levitation, transportation, rendering oneself invisible, creating illusions and glamour, reading minds, placing compulsions, working black magic, and a host of other abilities. We do not guarantee that Abramelin's techniques work, not that the results are desirable...","Occult,Occult,Magick,Fantasy,Magic,Nonfiction,Religion,Spirituality,Occult,Mysticism,Religion,Esoterica,Philosophy,Fantasy,Mythology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328865715l/1002484.jpg,486232115,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002484.The_Book_of_the_Sacred_Magic_of_Abramelin_The_Mage_As_Delivered_By_Abraham_The_Jew_Unto_His_Son_Lamech_As_A_Grimoire_of_The_15th_Century,268,"The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin, The Mage â€” As Delivered By Abraham The Jew Unto His Son Lamech â€” As A Grimoire of The 15th Century",88

A modern Buddhist Bible is the first anthology to bring together the writings from Buddhists, both Eastern and Western, that have redefined Buddhism for our era.,Forging a universal doctrine from the divergent traditions of China, Sri Lanka, Japan, Burma, Thailand, and Tibet, the makers of modern Buddhism saw it as a return to the origin, as renowned scholar Donald Lopez shows.

"P.M.H. Atwater,Melvin Morse",Hardcover,"""Atwater is earnest, helpful, boldly honest."" --,East West Journal, ,P. M. H. Atwater is unique in this world. As both a near-death survivor and a near-death researcher, she brings a remarkable perspective to her work. Her first book, ,Coming Back to Life, caused a major controversy in the field of near-death studies, and ,Beyond the Light, promises to do the same. ,It presents the most in-depth and comprehensive look at the near-death phenomenon, its after-effects and implications. She challenges the stereotype of the ""amazing grace"" near-death experience of a tunnel of light accompanied by a feeling of well-being. Atwater has provocative evidence of many different types of experiences, including those that are hell-like as well as transcendent. She also discusses and contrasts the experiences of those people who were dead for several days and then revived, those who attempted suicide, and the similarities and differences between near-death experiences and hallucinations. ,Atwater was the first near-death researcher to find that the experience changed the brain's physiology, actually altering its structure. While she was criticized for this bold assertion, subsequent findings have proved her correct. ,Beyond the Light, provocatively probes the ""electrical sensitivity"" that follows near-death episodes as well as the now-acknowledged ""brain-shifts,"" and considers how these findings might change our very notion of mortality. ,Atwater has interviewed hundreds who have experienced near-death and their loved ones and friends. Her conclusions and observations will challenge our assumptions about what we consider life, death, and the existence and evolution of the individual soul. Like almost everyone who has experienced near-death, Atwater has come away spiritually charged with a mission to share her perceptions and sensations. ,Beyond the Light, is about nightmares as well as miracles, joy as well as deep despair. Atwater makes a compelling case that near-death provides us with a fascinating window on one of life's greatest unknowns and sets the stage for our re-examination of what it means to be alive . . . and dead. ,Beyond the Light, also contains a thorough and exhaustively researched resource section for those looking for further reading and guidance to an understanding of this fascinating field of study. ,P. M. H. Atwater experienced three near-death experiences in 1977. She has been exploring this phenomenon ever since. She lives and works in Charlottesville, Virginia.","Science,Philosophy,Metaphysics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266693104l/1002636.jpg,1559722290,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002636.Beyond_the_Light,302,Beyond the Light: What Isn't Being Said about Near-Death Experience,55

In so doing, she provides both a detailed account of her apprenticeship in the art of sustained fieldwork and an insightful overview of thirty years of changes in the empirical and theoretical facets of ethnographic practice.

"Liu Yiming,Thomas Cleary",Paperback,"The ,I Ching ,, or ""Book of Change,"" is considered the oldest of the Chinese classics and has throughout history commanded unsurpassed prestige and popularity. Containing several layers of text and given numerous levels of interpretation, it has captured continuous attention for well over two thousand years. It has been considered a book of fundamental principles by philosophers, politicians, mystics, alchemists, yogins, diviners, sorcerers, and more recently by scientists and mathematicians. ,This first part of the present volume is the text of the ,I Ching , properâ€”the sixty-four hexagrams plus sayings on the hexagrams and their linesâ€”with the commentary composed by Liu I-ming, a Taoist adept, in 1796. The second part is Liu I-ming's commentary on the two sections added to the ,I Ching , by earlier commentators, believed to be members of the original Confucian school; these two sections are known as the Overall Images and the Mixed Hexagrams. In total, the book illuminates the Taoist inner teachings as practiced in the School of Complete Reality. ,Well versed in Buddhism and Confucianism as well as Taoism, Liu I-ming intended his work to be read as a guide to comprehensive self-realization while living an ordinary life in the world. In his attempt to lift the veil of mystery from the esoteric language of the ,I Ching ,, he employs the terminology of psychology, sociology, history, myth, and religion. This commentary on the ,I Ching , stands as a major contribution to the elucidation of Chinese spiritual genius.","Religion,Taoism,Religion,Philosophy,Occult,Divination,Spirituality,Self Help,Cultural,China,Psychology,Occult,Magick,Classics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389322560l/1002698.jpg,394743873,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002698.The_Taoist_I_Ching,338,The Taoist I Ching,10

In Matter, Ramke investigates not only the physical realities of our world but the qualities that make things important to us, that give them weight. These poems, often in the voice of a child, are full of yearning and anguish but also an appreciation for the enhanced perceptions and small pleasures to be found among the sadness. All lost things have the same voice, he says, and this universal voice reminds us of home and family and the simple connections of ordinary life - the things that matter. When I was a saint, begins the first poem, I did not have visions but I could see and did note the color of the world.

"Maxwell Richard Bennett,Daniel C. Dennett,John Rogers Searle,P.M.S. Hacker",Hardcover,"In ,Neuroscience and Philosophy, three prominent philosophers and a leading neuroscientist clash over the conceptual presuppositions of cognitive neuroscience. The book begins with an excerpt from Maxwell Bennett and Peter Hacker's ,Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience, (Blackwell, 2003), which questions the conceptual commitments of cognitive neuroscientists. Their position is then criticized by Daniel Dennett and John Searle, two philosophers who have written extensively on the subject, and Bennett and Hacker in turn respond.,Their impassioned debate encompasses a wide range of central themes: the nature of consciousness, the bearer and location of psychological attributes, the intelligibility of so-called brain maps and representations, the notion of qualia, the coherence of the notion of an intentional stance, and the relationships between mind, brain, and body. Clearly argued and thoroughly engaging, the authors present fundamentally different conceptions of philosophical method, cognitive-neuroscientific explanation, and human nature, and their exchange will appeal to anyone interested in the relation of mind to brain, of psychology to neuroscience, of causal to rational explanation, and of consciousness to self-consciousness.,In his conclusion Daniel Robinson (member of the philosophy faculty at Oxford University and Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University) explains why this confrontation is so crucial to the understanding of neuroscientific research. The project of cognitive neuroscience, he asserts, depends on the incorporation of human nature into the framework of science itself. In Robinson's estimation, Dennett and Searle fail to support this undertaking; Bennett and Hacker suggest that the project itself might be based on a conceptual mistake. Exciting and challenging, ,Neuroscience and Philosophy, is an exceptional introduction to the philosophical problems raised by cognitive neuroscience.","Philosophy,Science,Biology,Neuroscience,Psychology,Nonfiction,Writing,Essays,Academic,Humanities,Language,Neuroscience,Brain",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347344811l/100280.jpg,231140444,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100280.Neuroscience_and_Philosophy,215,"Neuroscience and Philosophy: Brain, Mind, and Language",111
Cindy Engel,Hardcover,"This is the first book on a fascinating new field in biology -- zoopharmacognosy, or animal self-medication -- and its lessons for humans. When Rachel Carson published SILENT SPRING, few people knew the meaning of the word ""ecology."" Even fewer people today probably know the meaning of ""zoopharmacognosy."" But that is about to change. In WILD HEALTH, Cindy Engel explores the extraordinary range of ways animals keep themselves healthy, carefully separating scientifically verifiable fact from folklore, hard data from daydreams. As with holistic medicine for humans, there turns out to be more fact in folklore than was previously thought., How do animals keep themselves healthy? They eat plants that have medicinal properties. They select the right foods for a nutritionally balanced diet, often doing a better job of it than humans do. Animals even seek out psychoactive substances -- they get drunk on fermented fruit, hallucinate on mushrooms, become euphoric with opium poppies. They also manipulate their own reproduction with plant chemistry, using some plants as aphrodisiacs and others to enhance fertility. WILD HEALTH includes scores of remarkable examples of the ways animals medicate themselves.,- Desert tortoises will travel miles to mine and eat the calcium needed to keep their shells strong.,- Monkeys, bears, coatis, and other animals rub citrus oils and pungent resins into their coats as insecticides and antiseptics against insect bites.,- Chimpanzees swallow hairy leaves folded in a certain way to purge their digestive tracts of parasites.,- Birds line their nests with plants that protect their chicks from blood-draining mites and lice., In other words, animals try to keep themselves healthy in many of the same ways humans do; in fact, much of early human medicine, including many practices being revived today as ""alternative medicine,"" arose through observations of animals. And, as WILD HEALTH, animals still have a lot to teach us. We could use a little more wild health ourselves.","Health,Nonfiction,Science,Food and Drink,Food,Outdoors,Wilderness,Environment,Nature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387734654l/1002811.jpg,618071784,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002811.Wild_Health,288,Wild Health: How Animals Keep Themselves Well and What We Can Learn From Them,99
Richard  Rogers,Paperback,"Nothing else damages the earthâ€™s environment more than our cities. As the worldâ€™s population has grown, our cities have burgeoned, and their impact on the environment worsened. Meanwhile, from the isolated, gated communities within Houston and Los Angeles, to the millions of residents of Bombay living in squalor, the city has failed to serve its ideal functionâ€”as the cradle of civilization, the engine of culture, and the inspiration for community and citizenship. In ,Cities for a Small Planet,, Sir Richard Rogers, one of the worldâ€™s leading architects and the designer of the Pompidou Center in Paris, demonstrates how future cities could provide the springboard for restoring humanityâ€™s harmony with its environment.Rogers outlines the disastrous impact cities have had and will continue to have on our world, from waste-saturated Tokyo Bay, to the massive plumes of pollution caused by Londonâ€™s traffic, to the depleted water resources of Mexico City. He traces these problems to the underlying social and cultural values that create themâ€”unchecked commercial zeal, selfish individualism, and a lack of community. Bringing to bear concepts such as that of â€œopen-mindedâ€ spaceâ€”places within cities that serve multiple functions such as markets, parks, and sidewalk cafesâ€”he explains how urban design can be used to give citizens a sense of shared experience. The city built with comfortable and safe public space can bring diverse groups together and breed a sense of tolerance, awareness, identity, and mutual respect. He calls for a new theoretical shift in the way cities do business and interact with the environment, arguing that many products come to market and are sold without figuring their social or environmental cost.Rogers goes on to describe the city of the future: one that is sustainable within its own environment; that can make a positive impact on its surroundings; that encourages communication among its citizens; that is compact and focused around neighborhoods; and that is beautiful, a city whose buildings and spaces spark the creative potential of its inhabitants.As our population grows larger, our planet grows smaller. ,Cities for a Small Planet, is a passionate and eloquent blueprint for the cities we must create in response, cities that provide for the needs of both their residents and the earth on which they live.","Architecture,Cities,Urbanism,Nonfiction,Design,Academic,Cities,Urban Planning",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348362975l/1002818.jpg,813335531,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002818.Cities_For_A_Small_Planet,196,Cities For A Small Planet,109

Michael Ruse,Hardcover,"Creation versus evolution: What seems like a cultural crisis of our day, played out in courtrooms and classrooms across the county, is in fact part of a larger story reaching back through the centuries. The views of both evolutionists and creationists originated as inventions of the Enlightenment - two opposed but closely related responses to a loss of religious faith in the Western world. In his latest book, Michael Ruse, a preeminent authority on Darwinian evolutionary thought and a leading participant in the ongoing debate, uncovers surprising similarities between evolutionist and creationist thinking. Exploring the underlying philosophical commitments of evolutionists, he reveals that those most hostile to religion are just as evangelical as their fundamentalist opponents. But more crucially, and reaching beyond the biblical issues at stake, he demonstrates that these two diametrically opposed ideologies have, since the Enlightenment, engaged in a struggle for the privilege of defining human origins, moral values, and the nature of reality. Highlighting modern-day partisans as divergent as Richard Dawkins and Left Behind authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. every stripe and belief and offers to all a new and productive way of understanding this unifying, if often bitter, quest.","Science,Religion,Biology,Evolution,Nonfiction,History,Science,Biology,Philosophy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348599121l/1002853.jpg,674016874,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002853.The_Evolution_Creation_Struggle,327,The Evolution-Creation Struggle,63
"Angus J.L. Menuge,Michael Ruse",Hardcover,"In the first study of its kind, Agents Under Fire defends a robust notion of agency and intentionality against eliminative and naturalistic alternatives, showing the interconnections between the philosophy of mind, theology, and Intelligent Design. Menuge argues that Behe's irreducible complexity is a challenge to reductionism not only in biology, but also in psychology, and shows the inability of the Darwinian psychology proposed by Dawkins, Dennett, and Steven Pinker to explain the integration, unity, direction, and reliability of rational thought. This fascinating defense against scientific materialism is the only book-length study relating Intelligent Design to contemporary issues in the philosophy of mind. Drawing on his experience as both a philosopher and a computer scientist, Menuge deftly shows the reader that the materialist's attempts to rid science of all commitment to teleology can only result in incoherence, and presents instead his own unique argument for the legitimacy of Intelligent Design.","Philosophy,Science,Pseudoscience,Intelligent Design",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348097594l/1002855.jpg,742534049,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002855.Agents_Under_Fire,264,Agents Under Fire: Materialism and the Rationality of Science,44

Stacy Carlson,Hardcover,"In 1842 Phineas T. Barnum is a young man, freshly arrived in New York and still unknown to the world. With uncanny confidence and impeccable timing, he transforms a dusty natural history museum into a great ark for public imagination. Barnum's museum, with its human wonders and extraordinary live animal menagerie, rises to become not only the nation's most popular attraction, but also a catalyst that ushers America out of a culture of glassed-in exhibits and into the modern age of entertainment.,In this kaleidoscopic setting, the stories of two compelling characters are brought to life. Emile Guillaudeu is the museum's grumpy taxidermist, who is horrified by the chaotic change Barnum brings to his beloved institution. Ana Swift is a professional giantess plagued by chronic pain and jaded by a world of gawkers. The differences between these two are many: one is isolated and spends his working hours making dead things look alive, while the other has people pushing against her, and reacting to her, every day. But they both move toward change, one against his will, propelled by a paradigm shift happening whether he likes it or not, and the other because she is struggling to survive. In many shapes and forms, metamorphosis is at the core of ,Among the Wonderful,. Pursuing this theme, the book weaves a world where upper Manhattan is still untrammeled wilderness, the Five Points is at the height of its bloody glory, and within the walls of Barnum's museum, ancient tribal feuds play out in the midst of an unlikely community of marvels.","Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Historical,Literature,19th Century,Literary Fiction,New York,Museology,Museums,Adult,Adult Fiction,Unfinished",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357764794l/10029149.jpg,1586421840,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10029149-among-the-wonderful,464,Among the Wonderful,105

Askold Krushelnycky,Paperback,"In December 2004, the world watched as hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians gathered to defy the results of a transparently rigged presidential election. The charismatic popular candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, had been poisoned and disfigured by his opponents. The security forces threatened violent repression. But the demonstrators stayed and, as international pressure grew, the corrupt old regime that had been supported by Putin's Kremlin was deposed. It was the most significant moment for Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall.,An Orange Revolution, is the gripping account of this historic uprising and the events that led to it. Ukraine was treated roughly by the twentieth century, occupied by the Germans and annexed by the Soviets. It saw guerrilla fighting after the Second World War and dissent was crushed by successive Communist administrations. Its history has been one of corruption, power struggles, organised crime, but a resiliently optimistic population.,Based on firsthand observation and interviews with major players and anonymous demonstrators alike, this is about a people who have forced a lasting change: judges who defied death threats, a murdered journalist, amateur musicians who composed an anthem for the people, and soldiers who staked their lives to back the opposition. ,An Orange Revolution ,also traces the story of the author's family, who paid a high price for speaking out. ,An Orange Revolution ,is a captivating book about a defining moment in European history.","Cultural,Ukraine,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320534108l/1002967.jpg,436206234,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002967.An_Orange_Revolution,368,An Orange Revolution: A Personal Journey Through Ukrainian History,96
Jigoro Kano,Hardcover,"In 1882 Jigoro Kano (1860-1938) founded Kodokan Judo at Eishoji Temple in Tokyo. It was the culmination of a lifelong devotion to the jujutsu of the past, which he reorganized while taking great care to retain its classical traditions. Historically, martial arts were practiced only by the elite in Japan. Kano, a renowned educator as well as a sportsman, is credited with popularizing the martial arts, and in particular, judo, among people in all levels of society.,When he was young, Kano studied jujutsu, a martial art practiced in Japan since feudal times, which involved throwing, hitting, kicking, stabbing, slashing, choking, bending and twisting limbs-and defenses against these attacks. After years of studying, he realized that although many different jujutsu techniques were taught, there was no one core value holding them together. Kano identified an all-pervasive principle- to make the most efficient use of mental and physical energy-and combined only those techniques in which this principle was correctly applied into modern judo. ""Ju"" means gentleness or giving way. ""Do"" means principle or the way. Judo, therefore is the Way of Gentleness, which implies that first giving way leads to ultimate victory. The Kodokan is literally, ""the school for studying the Way."" This book is a collection of Kano's essential teachings, selected and compiled from his wealth of writings and lectures spanning a period of fifty-one years. Today the International Judo Federation has 187 member countries and regions. As an official sport of the Olympic Games, judo has inspired young people of all nationalities, and Kodokan is universally recognized as the Mecca of Judo.","Combat,Martial Arts,Philosophy,War,Psychology,Nonfiction,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347256413l/1002968.jpg,4770030150,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002968.Mind_Over_Muscle,155,Mind Over Muscle: Writings from the Founder of Judo,90

Arthur Kleinman,Paperback,"From the Preface, by Arthur Kleinman:Patients and Healers in the Context of Culture presents a theoretical framework for studying the relationship between medicine, psychiatry, and culture. That framework is principally illustrated by materials gathered in field research in Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, from materials gathered in similar research in Boston. The reader will find this book contains a dialectical tension between two reciprocally related orientations: it is both a cross-cultural (largely anthropological) perspective on the essential components of clinical care and a clinical perspective on anthropological studies of medicine and psychiatry. That dialectic is embodied in my own academic training and professional life, so that this book is a personal statement.Â I am a psychiatrist trained in anthropology. I have worked in library, field, and clinic on problems concerning medicine and psychiatry in Chinese culture. I teach cross-cultural psychiatry and medical anthropology, but I also practice and teach consultation psychiatry and take a clinical approach to my major cross-cultural teaching and research involvements. The theoretical framework elaborated in this book has been applied to all of those areas; in turn, they are used to illustrate the theory. Both the theory and its application embody the same dialectic. The purpose of this book is to advance both poles of that dialectic: to demonstrate the critical role of social science (especially anthropology and cross-cultural studies) in clinical medicine and psychiatry and to encourage study of clinical problems by anthropologists and other investigators involved in cross-cultural research.","Anthropology,Health,Health Care,Health,Medicine,Psychology,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387715150l/1002980.jpg,520045114,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002980.Patients_and_Healers_in_the_Context_of_Culture,448,"Patients and Healers in the Context of Culture: An Exploration of the Borderland between Anthropology, Medicine, and Psychiatry",47

"Charles L. Harness,Brian W.

A slave state run by a small noble elite who flaunt their wealth by using, and abusing, the one commodity that only the rich can have: human labour. But working underground, persecuted by the police, is an organization dedicated to the overthrow of government and the existing way of life and the establishment of freedom'.

They were well equipped and trained for their job and had friends and informers in high places ready to reveal where the wealth of the nobles was hidden.

"Coco Irvine,Peg Meier",Paperback,"On Christmas Day, 1926, twelve-year-old Clotilde â€œCocoâ€ Irvine received a blank diary as a present. Coco loved to writeâ€”and to get into scrapesâ€”and her new diary gave her the opportunity to explain her side of the messes she created: â€œIâ€™m in deep trouble through no fault of my own,â€ her entries frequently began. The daughter of a lumber baron, Coco grew up in a twenty-room mansion on fashionable Summit Avenue at the peak of the Jazz Age, a time when music, art, and womenâ€™s social status were all in a state of flux and the economy was still flying high.,Cocoâ€™s diary carefully records her adventures, problems, and romances, written with a lively wit and a droll sense of humor.

James J. Lorence,Paperback,"In Georgia during the Great Depression, jobless workers united with the urban poor, sharecroppers, and tenant farmers. In a collective effort that cut across race and class boundaries, they confronted an unresponsive political and social system and helped shape government policies. James J. Lorence adds significantly to our understanding of this movement, which took place far from the northeastern and midwestern sites we commonly associate with Depression-era labor struggles.Drawing on extensive archival research, including newly accessible records of the Communist Party of the United States, Lorence details interactions between various institutional and grassroots players, including organized labor, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, liberal activists, and officials at every level of government. He shows, for example, how the Communist Party played a more central role than previously understood in the organization of the unemployed and the advancement of labor and working-class interests in Georgia. Communists gained respect among the jobless, especially African Americans, for their willingness to challenge officials, help negotiate the welfare bureaucracy, and gain access to New Deal social programs.,Lorence enhances our understanding of the struggles of the poor and unemployed in a Depression-era southern state. At the same time, we are reminded of their movement's lasting legacy: the shift in popular consciousness that took place as Georgians, ""influenced by a new sense of entitlement fostered by the unemployed organizations,"" began to conceive of new, more-equal relations with the state.","History,Labor",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328808417l/10031346.jpg,820338761,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10031346-the-unemployed-people-s-movement,328,"The Unemployed People's Movement: Leftists, Liberals, and Labor in Georgia, 1929-1941",95

Benny Green,Paperback,"The Reluctant Art,, first published in 1962 and long out-of-print, stands as one of the most important books on the art of jazz. Comprising five studiesâ€”of Bix Beiderbecke, Benny Goodman, Lester Young, Billie Holiday, and Charlie Parker (with the addition of an essay of Art Tatum for this new edition)â€”Benny Green's humorous, eloquent, and often angry book attempts to point out the gulf between the reality of the jazz musician and his music, on the one hand, and the romantic conceits of early jazz writing and fandom, on the other. Green, himself an excellent early jazz musician, was one of the first jazz writers to bring to the task firsthand knowledge of the music, and this illuminates his understanding of the factors involved in jazz innovation. He discusses jazz in terms of musical and social history, retelling the over-mythologized stories of these great artists with a unique combination of joyous irreverence and acute critical insight, of inspired metaphors and masterly knowledge. Benny Green's classic book swings with the same energy and passion as the timeless music it discusses.",Music,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266693231l/1003209.jpg,306804417,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003209.The_Reluctant_Art,210,The Reluctant Art,96

Long a target of J. Edgar Hoover's campaign to defame, infiltrate, and criminalize Black nationalist organizations and their leaders, Shakur was incarcerated for four years prior to her conviction on flimsy evidence in 1977 as an accomplice to murder.,This intensely personal and political autobiography belies the fearsome image of JoAnne Chesimard long projected by the media and the state. With wit and candor, Assata Shakur recounts the experiences that led her to a life of activism and portrays the strengths, weaknesses, and eventual demise of Black and White revolutionary groups at the hand ofÂ government officials. The result is a signal contribution to the literature about growing up Black in America that has already taken its place alongside ,The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and the works of Maya Angelou.,Two years after her conviction, Assata Shakur escaped from prison.

The justice department eventually rescinded Bin Wahad's conviction and he was released in 1990, seven months after the documentary premiered.,Mumia Abu-Jamal, a journalist who headed the Black Panther free breakfast program for inner-city school children in Philadelphia, was also accused of the murder of an officer and sent on death-row, where he still is today.,Assata Shakur was a college educated social worker in her twenties when she was accused of shooting a cop, then arrested and tortured and denied medical treatment.

Frank Thomas,Hardcover,"During the Spanish Civil War two young Welshmen volunteered to fight for their convictions - but on opposite sides. They had similar backgrounds. The elder, Frank Thomas, had a powerful yearning for military adventure. The younger, Sid Hamm, became a Communist before going to Spain. In April 1937, by now a battle-hardened veteran, Thomas was with Franco's Foreign Legion near the town of Brunete, helping to strengthen the Nationalist trenches. Hamm was just arriving in Spain to join the Republican International Brigade. Three months later, Thomas was back home, recuperating from terrible wounds, while Hamm met his death attempting to puncture the very defence works which Thomas had helped to construct. This story of a parochial civil war within the most defining of all civil wars has come to light through Robert Stradling's discovery of two unknown documents.

Merlin Coverley,Hardcover,"Psychogeography. Increasingly this term is used to illustrate a bewildering array of ideas from key lines and the occult, to urban walking and political radicalism. But where does it come from and what exactly does it mean? This book examines the origins of psychogeography in the Situationist Movement of the 1950s, exploring the theoretical background and its political applications as well as the work of early practitioners such as Guy Debord and Raoul Vaneigem. Elsewhere, psychogeographic ideas continue to find retrospective validation in much earlier traditions from the visionary writing of William Blake and Thomas De Quincey to the rise of the flaneur on the streets of 19th century Paris and on through the avant-garde experimentation of the Surrealists. These precursors to psychogeography are discussed here alongside their modern counterparts, for today these ideas hold greater currency than ever through the popularity of writers and filmmakers such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd, Stewart Home and Patrick Keiller. From Urban Wandering to Cognitive Mapping, from the Derive to Detournement,Â psychogeographyÂ provides us with new ways of apprehending our surroundings, transforming the familiar streets of our everyday experience into something new and unexpected. This guide conducts the reader through this process, offering both an explanation and definition of the terms involved, and an analysis of the key figures and their work as well as practical information on psychogeographical groups and organizations.","Nonfiction,Philosophy,Psychology,Cities,Urbanism,Philosophy,Theory,Cities,Urban Studies,Art,Politics,Travel,Walking,Sociology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328695431l/1003489.jpg,1904048617,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003489.Psychogeography,160,Psychogeography,69

June Thomson,Hardcover,"Exploring the friendship of the inscrutable sleuth Sherlock Holmes and his redoubtable companion, Doctor Watson -- a bond that survived forty-six years -- this scrupulously researched biography constructs the fascinating story of their relationship, for the most part from evidence in the massive canon of Arthur Conan Doyle. Speculative only when precise data is wanting, the book examines the personalities of its principals, traces the development of their partnership in crime detection, and considers such disputed aspects as the possible homosexual implications of their relationship, Holmes's disappearance for three years, and the identity of the second Mrs. Watson.With theories as to the location of 221B Baker Street, the person of the King of Bohemia, the dating of The Hound of the Baskervilles, and other matters long debated by Holmes experts, this volume will prove to be invaluable to all students of the Great Detective. And for anyone who has enjoyed Holmes in print or in film, television, and radio adaptations, it provides a detailed and engaging biographical account of one of literature's great immortal friendships.","Biography,Nonfiction,Mystery,Crime,Mystery,Literature,19th Century,European Literature,British Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1343336359l/1003634.jpg,786708271,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003634.Holmes_and_Watson,288,Holmes and Watson,106

They are an unlikely pair: Chuck Fipke, a ragged fanatical prospector with a singular talent for finding sand-size mineral grains, and Stew Blusson, an ultra-tough geologist and helicopter pilot. Inventive, eccentric, and ruthless, they follow a trail of clues left by predecessors-and a few actual gems-all the way from backwoods Arkansas up the glaciated high Rockies into the vast and haunted barren lands of northern Canada. With a South African geochemist's secret weapon, Fipke and Blusson outwit rivals, including the immense De Beers cartel, and make one of the world's greatest diamond discoveries-setting off a stampede unseen since the Klondike gold rush. ,Barren Lands ,offers an unforgettable journey for those who, in the words of a nineteenth-century trapper, ""want to see that country before it is all gone.""","History,Science,Geology,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1392551968l/1003674.jpg,805071857,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003674.Barren_Lands,442,Barren Lands: An Epic Search For Diamonds in the North American Artic,67
Margaret Creighton,Paperback,"From the voyage of the Argonauts to the Tailhook scandal, seafaring has long been one of the most glaringly male-dominated occupations. In this groundbreaking interdisciplinary study, Margaret Creighton, Lisa Norling, and their co-authors explore the relationship of gender and seafaring in the Anglo-American age of sail. Drawing on a wide range of American and British sourcesâ€”from diaries, logbooks, and account ledgers to songs, poetry, fiction, and a range of public sourcesâ€”the authors show how popular fascination with seafaring and the sailors' rigorous, male-only life led to models of gender behavior based on ""iron men"" aboard ship and ""stoic women"" ashore.,Yet ,Iron Men, Wooden Women, also offers new material that defies conventional views. The authors investigate such topics as women in the American whaling industry and the role of the captain's wife aboard ship. They explore the careers of the female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read, as well as those of other womenâ€”""transvestite heroines""â€”who dressed as men to serve on the crews of sailing ships. And they explore the importance of gender and its connection to race for African American and other seamen in both the American and the British merchant marine. Contributors include both social historians and literary critics: Marcus Rediker, Dianne Dugaw, Ruth Wallis Herndon, Haskell Springer, W. Jeffrey Bolster, Laura Tabili, Lillian Nayder, and Melody Graulich, in addition to Margaret Creighton and Lisa Norling.","History,Nonfiction,Adventure,Pirates,Feminism,Historical",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347584809l/1003688.jpg,801851602,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003688.Iron_Men_Wooden_Women,304,"Iron Men, Wooden Women: Gender and Seafaring in the Atlantic World, 1700-1920",18

Arthur I. Miller,Hardcover,"In August 1930, on a voyage from Madras to London, a young Indian looked up at the stars and contemplated their fate. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar--Chandra, as he was called--calculated that certain stars would suffer a strange and violent death, collapsing to virtually nothing. This extraordinary claim, the first mathematical description of black holes, brought Chandra into direct conflict with Sir Arthur Eddington, one of the greatest astrophysicists of the day. Eddington ridiculed the young man's idea at a meeting of the Royal Astronomy Society in 1935, sending Chandra into an intellectual and emotional tailspin--and hindering the progress of astrophysics for nearly forty years., Empire of the Stars is the dramatic story of this intellectual debate and its implications for twentieth-century science. Arthur I. Miller traces the idea of black holes from early notions of ""dark stars"" to the modern concepts of wormholes, quantum foam, and baby universes. In the process, he follows the rise of two great theories--relativity and quantum mechanics--that meet head on in black holes. Empire of the Stars provides a unique window into the remarkable quest to understand how stars are born, how they live, and, most portentously (for their fate is ultimately our own), how they die., It is also the moving tale of one man's struggle against the establishment--an episode that sheds light on what science is, how it works, and where it can go wrong. Miller exposes the deep-seated prejudices that plague even the most rational minds. Indeed, it took the nuclear arms race to persuade scientists to revisit Chandra's work from the 1930s, for the core of a hydrogen bomb resembles nothing so much as an exploding star. Only then did physicists realize the relevance, truth, and importance of Chandra's work, which was finally awarded a Nobel Prize in 1983., Set against the waning days of the British Empire and taking us right up to the present, this sweeping history examines the quest to understand one of the most forbidding phenomena in the universe, as well as the passions that fueled that quest over the course of a century.","Science,Nonfiction,Science,Physics,Biography,Science,Astronomy,History,Science,History Of Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347568323l/100377.jpg,061834151X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100377.Empire_of_the_Stars,384,"Empire of the Stars: Obsession, Friendship and Betrayal in the Quest for Black Holes",112
"AmÃ©lie Nothomb,Shaun Whiteside",Hardcover,"""To have an extraordinary life, Lucette believes, one must have an extraordinary name. Horrified by the pedestrian names her husband chooses for their unborn child (Tanguy if it's a boy, Joelle if it's a girl), Lucette does the only honorable thing to save her baby from such an unexceptional destiny - she kills her spouse. While in prison, Lucette gives birth to a daughter to whom she bequeaths the portentous name of an obscure saint, Plectrude, before hanging herself."" From her beginnings, Plectrude seems fated for a life like no other. Raised by an indulgent and adoring aunt, she is a dreamy child who is discovered to have enormous gifts as a dancer. Accepted at Paris's most prestigious ballet school, Plectrude devotes herself to artistic perfection, giving dance her heart and soul - and ultimately her body. As her world shatters as easily as her bones, she learns to survive in the only way she knows how - by committing an act of deadly self-preservation her mother would have understood best.","Fiction,Cultural,France,Contemporary,European Literature,French Literature,Cultural,Belgium,Roman,Literary Fiction,Novels,Literature,European Literature,Belgian",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311990084l/1003801.jpg,312320558,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003801.The_Book_of_Proper_Names,122,The Book of Proper Names,102
Jane Bradley,Hardcover,"You Believers is a powerful, cathartic story of casual evil and of how the worst things can be faced so that we might not only survive, but grow. A young woman goes missing, and her mother uproots her life to find her daughter. But it is not just the heartbreak or the deep mystery of the hunt for lost loved ones that Bradley so convincingly explores. Rather, with the help of an amazingly dedicated searcher, family and friends somehow learn to move past unspeakable horror and celebrate the tenacity of the human spirit. Offering a vision that is at once ruthless and utterly compassionate, Bradley renders the search for logic, meaning, redemption and even hope in the domino force that is human nature.,Part Southern gothic, part crime, part haunting suspense story, You Believers takes us on an infinitely harrowing journey that rewards the reader with insight into how we might endure horrible events with faith, strength, and grace even while it reveals the ripple effects of random violence.","Fiction,Mystery,Thriller,Mystery,Crime,Death,Suspense,Gothic,Southern Gothic,Horror",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347348661l/10038051.jpg,1609530462,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10038051-you-believers,416,You Believers,130
Otto Rank,Hardcover,"Originally published in German in 1909, Otto Rank's The Myth of the Birth of the Hero offered psychoanalytical interpretations of mythological stories as a means of understanding the human psyche. Like his mentor Freud, Rank compared the myths of such figures as Oedipus, Moses, and Sargon with common dreams, seeing in both a symbolic fulfillment of repressed desire. Thirteen years later, Rank substantially revised this seminal work, incorporating new discoveries in psychoanalysis, mythology, and ethnology, doubling the size of the book. This expanded second edition has never before been available in English.","Psychology,Fantasy,Mythology,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Religion,Self Help,Philosophy,Theory,Literature,Psychology,Psychoanalysis",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180142687l/1003819.jpg,801878837,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003819.The_Myth_of_the_Birth_of_the_Hero,106,The Myth of the Birth of the Hero: A Psychological Exploration of Myth,96
Aurel Bejancu,Hardcover,"The theory of foliations of manifolds was created in the forties of the last century by Ch. Ehresmann and G. Reeb [ER44]. Since then, the subject has enjoyed a rapid development and thousands of papers investigating foliations have appeared. A list of papers and preprints on foliations up to 1995 can be found in Tondeur [Ton97]. Due to the great interest of topologists and geometers in this rapidly ev- ving theory, many books on foliations have also been published one after the other. We mention, for example, the books written by: I. Tamura [Tam76], G. Hector and U. Hirsch [HH83], B. Reinhart [Rei83], C. Camacho and A.L. Neto [CN85], H. Kitahara [Kit86], P. Molino [Mol88], Ph. Tondeur [Ton88], [Ton97], V. Rovenskii [Rov98], A. Candel and L. Conlon [CC03]. Also, the survey written by H.B. Lawson, Jr. [Law74] had a great impact on the de- lopment of the theory of foliations. So it is natural to ask: why write yet another book on foliations? The answerisverysimple.Ourareasofinterestandinvestigationaredi?erent.The main theme of this book is to investigate the interrelations between foliations of a manifold on one hand, and the many geometric structures that the ma- foldmayadmitontheotherhand.Amongthesestructureswemention: a?ne, Riemannian, semi-Riemannian, Finsler, symplectic, and contact structures.","Science,Mathematics,Mathematics,Geometry",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348647995l/1003832.jpg,1402037198,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003832.Foliations_and_Geometric_Structures,300,Foliations and Geometric Structures,134

Ariano Suassuna,Paperback,"O romance A histÃ³ria do amor de Fernando e Isaura foi a primeira experiÃªncia de Ariano Suassuna no campo da prosa de ficÃ§Ã£o.

A histÃ³ria do amor de Fernando e Isaura Ã© uma espÃ©cie de versÃ£o brasileira de TristÃ£o e Isolda (historia imortalizada pela- obra de Joseph BÃ©dier) e, como o prÃ³prio autor declarou, lhe serviu para avaliar e exercitar as forÃ§as de que dispunha para escrever o grande romance com que vinha sonhando - o clÃ¡ssico Â´Romance dÂ´A Pedra do ReinoÂ´, escrito entre 1958 e 1970. A histÃ³ria do amor de Fernando e Isaura Ã© uma paixÃ£o proibida. Um amor tÃ£o verdadeiro e intenso que, impedido de ser vivenciado em toda a sua plenitude, encaminha-se para um trÃ¡gico desfecho. AtÃ© hoje, Ã© o Ãºnico romance de Suassuna que nÃ£o se passa na ParaÃ­ba e, alÃ©m disso, ao contrario do que aparece em toda a sua obra, o SertÃ£o encontra-se praticamente ausente da narrativa: seu cenÃ¡rio e Alagoas, com grande parte das aÃ§Ãµes decorrendo nas proximidades do mar.

Douglas  Hunter,Hardcover,"Skilled, determined, tireless, and courageous, Steve Yzerman may be the most revered player in the NHL today. Drawing on the insights of coaches, teammates and league insiders, award-winning writer Douglas Hunter charts Yzerman's career as ""the player's player,"" the embodiment of skill, dedication, sacrifice, and leadership.,Yzerman went fourth overall to the Detroit Red Wings in the very strong 1983 NHL entry draft, which included such prospects as Tom Barasso, Cam Neely, and Pat LaFontaine. He made an immediate impact in the NHL with his dazzling offensive skills. In 1986, having just turned 21, he was made the youngest captain in league history.,Despite his individual success, including being one of the only three players in NHL history to record a 155-point season, Yzerman's team struggled and Detroit's devoted hockey fans wondered when he would reverse the Red Wings' fortunes. When Detroit was unexpectedly bumped from the playoffs in the '95 Stanley Cup final, many fingers, pointed at the captain. Determined to bring a championship back to Detroit, shrugging off persistent trade rumors, Yzerman continued to adjust his game for the good of the team. While his finesse as a playmaker and goal scorer remained in evidence, the gritty centerman blocked shots, drove to the net, and worked tirelessly along the boards in the corners. He led by aggressive example on the ice and with quiet confidence in the dressing room.,In 1997, when the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup since 1955, Yzerman proved he was a winner. He proved it again the next season, when he raised the Cup for a second time and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs' most valuable player. In 2002 the team captured its third Stanley Cup in seven seasons and that same year Yzerman was pivotal in Team Canada's Olympic gold medal victory.","Sports,Sports,Sports,Hockey,Biography,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344679625l/1003919.jpg,157243676X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003919.Yzerman,288,Yzerman: The Making of a Champion,115

Flann O'Brien,Hardcover,"Flann Oâ€™Brien, along with Joyce and Beckett, is part of the holy trinity of modern Irish literature. His five novelsâ€“collected here in one volumeâ€“are a monument to his inspired lunacy and gleefully demented genius. ,Oâ€™Brienâ€™s masterpiece, ,At Swim-Two-Birds,, is an exuberant literary send-up and one of the funniest novels of the twentieth century. The novelâ€™s narrator is writing a novel about another man writing a novel, in a Celtic knot of interlocking stories. The riotous cast of characters includes figures â€œstolenâ€ from Gaelic legends, along with assorted students, fairies, ordinary Dubliners, and cowboys, some of whom try to break free of their authorâ€™s control and destroy him., The narrator of ,The Third Policeman,, who has forgotten his name, is a student of philosophy who has committed murder and wanders into a surreal hell where he encounters such oddities as the ghost of his victim, three policeman who experiment with space and time, and his own soul (who is named â€œJoeâ€)., ,The Poor Mouth,, a bleakly hilarious portrait of peasants in a village dominated by pigs, potatoes, and endless rain, is a giddy parody aimed at those who would romanticize Gaelic culture. A naÃ¯ve young orphan narrates the deadpan farce The Hard Life, and The Dalkey Archive is an outrageous satiric fantasy featuring a mad scientist who uses relativity to age his whiskey, a policeman who believes men can turn into bicycles, and an elderly, bar-tending James Joyce.

Tomoko Masuzawa,Paperback,"The idea of ""world religions"" expresses a vague commitment to multiculturalism. Not merely a descriptive concept, ""world religions"" is actually a particular ethos, a pluralist ideology, a logic of classification, and a form of knowledge that has shaped the study of religion and infiltrated ordinary language.,In this ambitious study, Tomoko Masuzawa examines the emergence of ""world religions"" in modern European thought. Devoting particular attention to the relation between the comparative study of language and the nascent science of religion, she demonstrates how new classifications of language and race caused Buddhism and Islam to gain special significance, as these religions came to be seen in opposing terms-Aryan on one hand and Semitic on the other. Masuzawa also explores the complex relation of ""world religions"" to Protestant theology, from the hierarchical ordering of religions typical of the Christian supremacists of the nineteenth century to the aspirations of early twentieth-century theologian Ernst Troeltsch, who embraced the pluralist logic of ""world religions"" and by so doing sought to reclaim the universalist destiny of European modernity.","Religion,History,Philosophy,Theory,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Academic,Spirituality,Religion,Theology,Anthropology,Academic,School",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328873871l/1004046.jpg,226509893,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1004046.The_Invention_of_World_Religions,359,"The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism",135

Sten Nadolny,Paperback,""",Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit,"" ist auf den ersten Blick zugleich ein Seefahrerroman, ein Roman Ã¼ber das Abenteuer und die Sehnsucht danach und ein Entwicklungsroman. Doch hat Sten Nadolny die Biographie des englischen Seefahrers und Nordpolforschers John Franklin (1786-1847) zu einer subtilen Studie Ã¼ber die Zeit umgeschrieben: die Langsamkeit als eine Kunst, dem Rhythmus des Lebens Sinn zu verleihen. Wie bei einem Palimpsest erscheint hinter den SÃ¤tzen eine andere Schrift, hinter der PrÃ¤gnanz und Redlichkeit der AufklÃ¤rung verbergen sich Humor und Traurigkeit der Romantik.,Von Kindheit an trÃ¤umt John Franklin davon, zur See zu fahren, obwohl er dafÃ¼r denkbar ungeeignet ist: Langsam im Sprechen und Denken, langsam in seinen Reaktionen miÃŸt er die Zeit nach eigenen MaÃŸstÃ¤ben. ZunÃ¤chst erkennt nur sein Lehrer, daÃŸ Johns eigenartige Behinderung auch VorzÃ¼ge hat - was er einmal erfaÃŸt hat, das behÃ¤lt er, das Einzigartige, das Detail begreift er besser als andere. John Franklin geht zur Marine, erlebt den Krieg und das Sterben. Beides trifft ihn um so furchtbarer, als er innerhalb des von ihm kaum begriffenen, chaotisch schnellen Geschehens einzelne VorgÃ¤nge wie in Zeitlupe ablaufen sieht. Er trÃ¤umt von friedlicher Entdeckung, will die legendÃ¤re Nordwestpassage finden.","Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,European Literature,German Literature,Novels,Historical,Travel,Philosophy,Contemporary,Roman,Classics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1166112932l/10040._SY475_.jpg,3492207006,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10040.Die_Entdeckung_der_Langsamkeit,358,Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit,45

Joseph Nigg,Hardcover,"Dragons, unicorns, griffins, and sea monsters are only some of the many fantastic animals that continue to enthrall people, even though such creatures exist only in our imaginations. As such, they have animated human folklore for thousands of years, serving as metaphors for our fears, hopes, dreams, and struggles. Here is a modern collection of lore that reflects many different cultures as it focuses on a panoply of fantastic animals. From ancient Greece came the griffin, a combination eagle and lion who guarded a treasure of gold, and whose feathers gave sight to the blind. From Egypt came the mysterious Sphinx, half human and half lion, and from Persia came Karkadan, a large, ferocious, one-horned monster who could be captured and subdued only by a young maiden. Not all mythical beasts are fierce. Lung and other Chinese dragons are cheerful and benevolent, and Drakon was reputed to be a loyal guard of the Greeks' sacred springs and treasures. This profusely illustrated book tells stories of winged birds, scaled serpents, and legendary sea creatures. It also features a unique family tree of legendary bestial correspondences that traces dragon relationships from one culture's folklore to another.

Sara  Seager,ebook,"Over the past twenty years, astronomers have identified hundreds of extrasolar planets--planets orbiting stars other than the sun. Recent research in this burgeoning field has made it possible to observe and measure the atmospheres of these exoplanets. This is the first textbook to describe the basic physical processes--including radiative transfer, molecular absorption, and chemical processes--common to all planetary atmospheres, as well as the transit, eclipse, and thermal phase variation observations that are unique to exoplanets., In each chapter, Sara Seager offers a conceptual introduction, examples that combine the relevant physics equations with real data, and exercises. Topics range from foundational knowledge, such as the origin of atmospheric composition and planetary spectra, to more advanced concepts, such as solutions to the radiative transfer equation, polarization, and molecular and condensate opacities. Since planets vary widely in their atmospheric properties, Seager emphasizes the major physical processes that govern all planetary atmospheres., Moving from first principles to cutting-edge research, ,Exoplanet Atmospheres, is an ideal resource for students and researchers in astronomy and earth sciences, one that will help prepare them for the next generation of planetary science., The first textbook to describe exoplanet atmospheres, Illustrates concepts using examples grounded in real data, Provides a step-by-step guide to understanding the structure and emergent spectrum of a planetary atmosphere, Includes exercises for students",Textbooks,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356036014l/10045438.jpg,1400835305,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10045438-exoplanet-atmospheres,264,Exoplanet Atmospheres: Physical Processes,14

"Sam Kashner,Nancy Schoenberger",Paperback,"Oscar Levant was the Amadeus of Hollywood, the Oscar Wilde of Broadway -- and the most wildly self-destructive personality ever to become a household name. An astonishingly gifted concert pianist, composer, film and stage presence, radio and television raconteur, insult wit, and bestselling author, Levant steered a maniacally masochistic course through seven glorious decades. His death in 1972, at the age of 65, left the entertainment community shocked -- largely with amazement that a four-pack-a-day smoker with a history of drug abuse and mental illness had lasted as long as Levant did. He made a national reputation for himself in the late '30s as a brash, brilliant 'expert' on radio's famed quiz show 'Information, Please!', and as a fine concert pianist and the premier interpreter of George Gershwin's concert works. He appeared in 13 films, usually as a best friend/'Oscar Levant' type. He played Gene Kelly's sidekick in 'An American in Paris' and a lovable hypochondriac in 'The Band Wagon, ' and in the film biography 'Rhapsody in Blue, ' he literally played himself: Oscar Levant, best friend to George Gershwin, a role he knew all too well. His hero worship of Gershwin stunted his confidence as a songwriter and a serious composer, though one of his pop songs, 'Blame It on My Youth, ' has become a standard, and Arnold Schoenberg, Aaron Copeland, and Virgil Thomson all thought Levant an immensely gifted composer. Levant's addiction to Demerol following a heart attack in the early '50s led to nearly a decade of drug dependency. Already hobbled by complex superstitions meant to ward off the terrors of performing, Levant was almost destroyed by his addictions. But his intense neurosisdidn't keep him from appearing on television to talk about it. His uncensored comments on 'The Jack Paar Show' and on his own local Los Angeles talk show made national news. ""A Talent for Genius,"" the result of exhausting research and hundreds of hours of interviews, is a profoundly revelation.","Biography,Music,Nonfiction,Culture,Film",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180150526l/1004575._SX318_.jpg,1879505398,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1004575.A_Talent_for_Genius,512,A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant,56
Germano Celant,Hardcover,"A groundbreaking work, edited by Germano Celant in collaboration with the artist and her New York studio, which enriches our knowledge of Louise Bourgeois. Over a long career she worked through most of the twentieth century's avant-garde artistic movements from abstraction to realism, yet always remained uniquely individual, powerfully inventive, and often at the forefront of contemporary art. She was one of the worldâ€™s most respected sculptors, best known for her public-space pieces, grand-scale sculptures of spiders so large they must rest outside. But beginning in the 1960s, she used her own clothing and that of her loved ones as components of her sculptures and designs: a reincarnation of her childhood and her past. Her art would expand into new realms in 2002 when she began to weave together scraps of iridescent-colored fabric, creating works that vary from figures of flowers to chromatic abstractions, constituting a repertoire of truly surprising interweaves. This set of images is collected here in its entirety for the first time, constituting the closest thing yet to a general catalog.","Art,Nonfiction,Art,Art Design",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320564988l/10045895.jpg,8857206548,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10045895-louise-bourgeois-the-fabric-works,336,Louise Bourgeois The Fabric Works,47

From Abaia and Abath to Ziz and Zu, from the microscopic Gigelorum that nests in a mite's ear to the giant serpent Jormungandor who encircles the whole globe, there are beasts from every corner of man's imagination: the light-hearted Fearsome Critters of lumberjack tales find a place alongside the Sirrush of Babylon and the Winged Bulls of Assyria. Some of the fabulous beasts turn out to be real creatures in disguise - a Cameleopard is a kind of glamourised giraffe -while others are almost, but not quite, human.

Cross-Cultural Consumption is a fascinating guide to the cultural implications of the globalization of a consumer society. The chapters address topics ranging from the clothing of colonial subjects in South Africa and the rise of the hypermarket in Argentina, to the presentation of culture in international tourist hotels. Through their examination of cultural imperialism and cultural appropriation of the representation of otherness and identity, Howes and his contributors show how the increasingly global flow of goods and images challenges the very idea of the cultural border and creates new spaces for cultural invention.

"William Clayton,George D. Smith",Paperback,"William Clayton is best remembered today for his hymns, especially â€œCome, Come Ye Saints.â€ But as one of the earliest Latter-day Saint scribes, he made intellectual as well as artistic contributions to his church, and his records have been silently incorporated into official Mormon scripture and history. Of equal significance are his personal impressions of day-to-day activities, which describe a social and religious world largely unfamiliar to modern readers.In ministering to the sick, for instance, Clayton anointed with perfumed oil and rum. He performed baptisms to heal the sick. Church services, held irregularly, were referred to as â€œgoing to meetingâ€ and seemed to be elective. He testifies of people speaking in tongues and of others â€œalmost speaking in tongues.â€ When introduced to plural marriage, he was reluctant but eventually became one of its most enthusiastic proponents, marrying ten women and fathering forty-two children.,Since polygamy was initially secret, Clayton spent much of his time putting out the fires of innuendo and discontent. He caught his first plural wife rendezvousing with her former fiancÃ©; later, when she became pregnant, her motherâ€“his unaware mother-in-lawâ€“was so overwrought that she attempted suicide. Joseph Smith reassured him: â€œJust keep her at home and brook it and if they raise trouble about it and bring you before me I will give you an awful scourging and probably cut you off from the church and then I will set you ahead as good as ever.â€ Clayton was also the object of Emma Smithâ€™s attentions, allegedly part of a jealous wifeâ€™s plan to make a cuckold of her errant husband.","Christianity,Lds",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358265306l/1004612.jpg,1560850221,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1004612.An_Intimate_Chronicle,678,An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton,52
Jason K. Stearns,Hardcover,"At the heart of Africa is Congo, a country the size of Western Europe, bordering nine other nations, that since 1996 has been wracked by a brutal and unstaunchable war in which millions have died. And yet, despite its epic proportions, it has received little sustained media attention. In this deeply reported book, Jason Stearns vividly tells the story of this misunderstood conflict through the experiences of those who engineered and perpetrated it. He depicts village pastors who survived massacres, the child soldier assassin of President Kabila, a female Hutu activist who relives the hunting and methodical extermination of fellow refugees, and key architects of the war that became as great a disaster as--and was a direct consequence of--the genocide in neighboring Rwanda. Through their stories, he tries to understand why such mass violence made sense, and why stability has been so elusive.,Through their voices, and an astonishing wealth of knowledge and research, Stearns chronicles the political, social, and moral decay of the Congolese State.","History,Cultural,Africa,Nonfiction,War,Politics,Eastern Africa,Rwanda,War,Military Fiction,History,World History,Political Science,International Relations,Military,Military History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328757755l/10046142.jpg,1586489291,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10046142-dancing-in-the-glory-of-monsters,400,Dancing in the Glory of Monsters: The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africa,49

The long deconstructionist era was followed with a period dominated by Deleuze, which has in turn evolved into a new situation still difficult to define. However, one common thread running through the new brand of continental positions is a renewed attention to materialist and realist options in philosophy. Among the leaders of the established generation, this new focus takes numerous forms. It might be hard to find many shared positions in the writings of Badiou, DeLanda, Laruelle, Latour, Stengers, and i ek, but what is missing from their positions is an obsession with the critique of written texts. All of them elaborate a positive ontology, despite the incompatibility of their results. Meanwhile, the new generation of continental thinkers is pushing these trends still further, as seen in currents ranging from transcendental materialism to the London-based speculative realism movement to new revivals of Derrida. As indicated by the title The Speculative Turn, the new currents of continental philosophy depart from the text-centered hermeneutic models of the past and engage in daring speculations about the nature of reality itself.

Meg Meeker,Hardcover,"The pressure on women today has pushed many American mothers to the breaking point. It feels as if â€œdoing your bestâ€ is never enough to please everyone, and the demands mothers place on themselves are both impossible and unrealistic. Now Meg Meeker, M.D., critically acclaimed author of ,Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters,, puts her twenty-five yearsâ€™ experience as a practicing pediatrician and counselor into a sound, sane approach to reshaping the frustrating, exhausting lives of so many moms. Â ,Mothers are expected to do it all: raise superstar kids, look great, make good salaries, volunteer for everything, run errands, keep a perfect house, be the perfect wife. Single mothers often have even more demandsâ€”and less support. In this rallying cry for change, Dr. Meeker incorporates clinical data and her own experience raising four children to show why mothers suffer from the rising pressure to excel and the toll it takes on their emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual health. Too many mothers are increasingly lonely, anxious, depressed, and unhappy with themselves, refusing to let themselves off the hook. Here, Dr. Meeker has identified the 10 most positive habits of mothers who are healthy, happy, and fulfilled. The key is to embrace a new perspective and create real joy and purpose by utilizing such core habits as,Â  , â€¢ making friends with those who know the meaning of friendship, â€¢ finding out what money can buy (and what it cannot), â€¢ lightening the overloadâ€”and doing less more often, â€¢ discovering faith and learning how to trust it, â€¢ taking some alone time and reviving yourself, Â , Mothers, itâ€™s time to view the unconditional trust that you see in your childrenâ€™s eyes when they take your hand or find your face in a crowd as a mirror of your own wonder and worth. You are the light that shines in their lives, the beacon that guides them. By implementing the key strategies in Dr. Meekerâ€™s book, you can be happy, hopeful, and a wonderful role model.

Miguel AmorÃ³s,Paperback,"Â«La historia de nuestra guerra civil estÃ¡ llena de cuestiones cuya resoluciÃ³n objetiva es una necesidad para aquellos que luchan contra la destrucciÃ³n del conocimiento histÃ³rico emprendido desde el poder, porque la liquidaciÃ³n de la memoria histÃ³rica asociada al proletariado significarÃ­a la eliminaciÃ³n de toda perspectiva revolucionaria. La figura de Durruti, en tanto que personificaciÃ³n de la revoluciÃ³n proletaria anarquista de 1936 concentrÃ³ muchas de esas cuestiones, verdaderas heridas del movimiento libertario, que en su propio beneficio conviene mantener abiertas y hurgar en ellas. Si duelen, es signo de que sus ideas perviven. Esas ideas no tienen precio. Quienes trataron de venderlas, se vendieron sÃ³lo a sÃ­ mismos. El anarquismo o es radical o no es nada. Sin embargo en los tiempos del espectÃ¡culo y la cultura de masas el pasado vendrÃ­a ser una mercancÃ­a moderna, consumible como cualquier otra. Un objeto cultural de entretenimiento asequible en cuadernos coleccionables, DVDs o series televisivas. La banda de historiadores de la universidad ya no tiene por funciÃ³n la falsificaciÃ³n o la ocultaciÃ³n del pasado como hacÃ­an los estalinistas sino su conversiÃ³n en espectÃ¡culo. El primer paso de esa preparaciÃ³n para el consumo ha sido la museificaciÃ³n. La historia para la pandilla universitaria serÃ­a un enorme panteÃ³n de cadÃ¡veres a los que se podrÃ­a despedazar y analizar como se harÃ­a con las momias de Egipto. La distancia que nos separa de ellos serÃ­a tan fabulosa que nada habrÃ­a que temer. El punto de vista forense certificarÃ­a el lejano momento de la defunciÃ³n y desplegarÃ­a un abanico de hipÃ³tesis a escoger. Ese aspecto ""plural"" es el marchamo de la mercancÃ­a ; en el espectÃ¡culo importa poco la moraleja. Se trabaja para el olvido pero de otra manera : si los historiadores estalinistas se servÃ­an del presente para reescribir el pasado, los actuales expertos de niversidad se sirven del pasado para mistificar el presente. La historia-espectÃ¡culo legitima la dominaciÃ³n como si Ã©sta no tuviera que ver con aquÃ©l ; embalsamando cadÃ¡veres, el poder quiere mostrarse como el heredero legal de los vencidos y no como el vencedor de la vÃ­spera. Como buen usurpador, quiere que no se sepa que es un reciÃ©n llegado, que su pasado es reciente, que prÃ¡cticamente no tiene historia. Que estÃ¡ ahÃ­ porque nadie se decide a echarlo. Un buen ejemplo ha sido el ""socialismo libertario"" que hace unos aÃ±os sacÃ³ de la chistera el presidente Zapatero. La mercantilizaciÃ³n espectacular de la guerra civil corresponderÃ­a a una pÃ©rdida total del sentido histÃ³rico en las masas, vacÃ­as y atemorizadas. No obstante dicha pÃ©rdida no es completa y por lo tanto, tiene remedio. TodavÃ­a la historia no es de quien la manipula. Durruti no ha muerto.Â»","Civil War,Spanish Civil War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1293508812l/10047799.jpg,8496044734,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10047799-durruti-en-el-laberinto,120,Durruti en el laberinto,106

"Johanna Sinisalo,Herbert Lomas",Paperback,"Everyone has their rough nights, but things have clearly taken a turn for the surreal when Angel, a young photographer, finds a group of drunken teenagers in the courtyard of his apartment building, taunting a young troll. Trolls are known in Scandinavian mythology as wild beasts like the werewolf, but this troll is just a small, wounded creature. Angel decides to offer it a safe haven for the night. In the morning Angel thinks he dreamed it all. But he finds the troll alive, well, and drinking from his toilet. What does one do with a troll in the city?,Angel begins researching frantically. Angel searches the Internet, folklore, nature journals, and newspaper clippings, but his research doesn't tell him that trolls exude pheromones that have a profound aphrodisiac effect on all those around him. As Angel's life changes beyond recognition, it becomes clear that the troll is familiar with the man's most forbidden feelings, and that it may take him across lines he never thought he'd cross.

Can a proper young Victorian lady find true love in the arms of a dashing zombie? ,The year is 2195. The place is New Victoria - a high-tech nation modeled on the manners, mores, and fashions of an antique era. A teenager in high society, Nora Dearly is far more interested in military history and her countryâ€™s political unrest than in tea parties and debutante balls. But after her beloved parents die, Nora is left at the mercy of her domineering aunt, a social-climbing spendthrift who has squandered the family fortune and now plans to marry her niece off for money. For Nora, no fate could be more horrible - until sheâ€™s nearly kidnapped by an army of walking corpses. ,But fate is just getting started with Nora. Catapulted from her world of drawing-room civility, sheâ€™s suddenly gunning down ravenous zombies alongside mysterious black-clad commandos and confronting â€œThe Laz,â€ a fatal virus that raises the dead - and hell along with them. Hardly ideal circumstances. Then Nora meets Bram Griswold, a young soldier who is brave, handsome, noble . . . and dead. But as is the case with the rest of his special undead unit, luck and modern science have enabled Bram to hold on to his mind, his manners, and his body parts. And when his bond of trust with Nora turns to tenderness, thereâ€™s no turning back. Eventually, they know, the disease will win, separating the star-crossed lovers forever. But until then, beating or not, their hearts will have what they desire.,In ,Dearly, Departed,, romance meets walking-dead thriller, spawning a madly imaginative novel of rip-roaring adventure, spine-tingling suspense, and macabre comedy that forever redefines the concept of undying love.","Young Adult,Science Fiction,Steampunk,Horror,Zombies,Romance,Fantasy,Paranormal,Fantasy,Science Fiction,Dystopia,Science Fiction,Horror,Romance,Paranormal Romance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358273477l/10048874.jpg,345523318,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10048874-dearly-departed,470,"Dearly, Departed",44

Patrik S. Schumacher,Hardcover,"Take a theoretical approach to architecture with ,The Autopoiesis of Architecture,, which presents the topic as a discipline with its own unique logic. Architecture's conception of itself is addressed as well as its development within wider contemporary society. Author Patrik Schumacher offers innovative treatment that enriches architectural theory with a coordinated arsenal of concepts facilitating both detailed analysis and insightful comparisons with other domains, such as art, science and politics. He explores how the various modes of communication comprising architecture depend upon each other, combine, and form a unique subsystem of society that co-evolves with other important autopoietic subsystems like art, science, politics and the economy.,The first of two volumes that together present a comprehensive account of architecture's autopoiesis, this book elaborates the theory of architecture's autopoeisis in 8 parts, 50 sections and 200 chapters. Each of the 50 sections poses a thesis drawing a central message from the insights articulated within the respective section. The 200 chapters are gathering and sorting the accumulated intelligence of the discipline according to the new conceptual framework adopted, in order to catalyze and elaborate the new formulations and insights that are then encapsulated in the theses. However, while the theoretical work in the text of the chapters relies on the rigorous build up of a new theoretical language, the theses are written in ordinary language ? with the theoretical concepts placed in brackets. The full list of the 50 theses affords a convenient summary printed as appendix at the end of the book.,The second volume completes the analysis of the discourse and further proposes a new agenda for contemporary architecture in response to the challenges and opportunities that confront architectural design within the context of current societal and technological developments.",Architecture,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1302156014l/10048929.jpg,470772999,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10048929-the-autopoiesis-of-architecture-volume-i,478,"The Autopoiesis of Architecture, Volume I: A New Framework for Architecture",87

Susan Starr Sered,Paperback,"Religion is often denounced as one of the tools used by patriarchal societies to maintain the status quo, and especially to persuade women to accept subordinate roles. This does not explain, however, the existence of many religious groups in which women are both leaders and the majority of participants. How are these women's religions different from those dominated by men? What can we learn from them about the special ways in which women experience their unique reality? In this fascinating and pathbreaking work--the first comparative study of women's religions--Susan Starr Sered seeks answers to these compelling questions., Looking for common threads linking groups as diverse as the ancestral cults of the Black Caribs of Belize, Korean shamanism, Christian Science, and the Feminist Spirituality movement, Sered finds that motherhood and motherly concerns play a vital role in these female-dominated groups. Nurturing and concern for others are at the center, as are healing arts and ways of dealing with illness and the death of children. Religion not only enables women to find sacred meaning in their daily lives, from the preparation of food to caring for their families, but an offer intense and personal relationships with deities and spirits--often through ecstatic possession trance--as well as opportunities to celebrate and mourn with other women., By examining the shared experiences of women across great cultural divides, ,Priestess, Mother, Sacred Sister, offers a new understanding of the role gender plays in determining how individuals grapple with the ultimate questions of existence. In the process, it not only highlights the profound differences between men and women, but the equally important ways in which we are all alike.","Religion,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348231362l/1005031.jpg,195104676,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1005031.Priestess_Mother_Sacred_Sister,352,"Priestess, Mother, Sacred Sister: Religions Dominated by Women",118

Kalinke offers the first book-length study of the Arthurian literature translated from French and Latin into Old Norse-Icelandic in the thirteenth century. Â Preserved mostly in Icelandic manuscripts, in early modern times these Scandinavian Arthurian legends inspired the composition of narrative poems and chapbooks in Denmark, Iceland, and Norway, chiefly of the Tristan legend. The importation of Arthurian literature in the North, primarily French romances and lais, is indebted largely to the efforts of King HÃ¡kon HÃ¡konarson (r. 1217â€“63) of Norway, who commissioned the translation of Thomas de Bretagneâ€™s ,Tristan ,in 1226, and subsequently several Arthurian romances by ChrÃ©tien de Troyes and a number of Breton lais.

"Ross Chapin,Sarah Susanka",Hardcover,"Pocket Neighborhoods: Creating Small Scale Community in a Large Scale World ,introduces an antidote to faceless, placeless sprawl â€” small scale neighborhoods where people can easily know one another, where empty nesters and single householders with far-flung families can find friendship or a helping hand nearby, and where children can have shirt-tail aunties and uncles just beyond their front gate.The book describes inspiring pocket neighborhoods through stories of the people who live there, as well as the progressive planners, innovative architects, pioneering developers, craftspeople and gardeners who helped create them.,Sarah Susanka, author of the best selling â€œNot So Big Houseâ€ series, wrote the Foreword to the book, placing pocket neighborhoods within context of the contemporary trends in housing and community. RossÂ ChapinÂ begins the book by outlining the shifts in the scale of community and the American Dream over several generations, leading to super-sized houses in a sea of development, then describes a solution to help restore healthy, livable communities. The first section of the book looks at historic precedents of pocket neighborhoods, from 15th century hofje almshouses in the Netherlands, to a 19th century Methodists Camp Community on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, to early 20th century Garden City models and Southern California Cottage Courtyards. The second section covers a wide range of contemporary pocket neighborhoods, including New Urban communities, affordable housing, houseboat communities, eco-neighborhoods, and Ross Chapin Architectsâ€™ own pocket neighborhood examples. The third section focuses on â€˜cohousingâ€™ communities, from Danish origins in the 1960s, to examples across America, Australia and New Zealand, including a chapter on senior cohousing. The fourth section looks at retrofitting pocket neighborhoods within existing communities. Throughout the book are series of â€œDesign Keysâ€ that highlight the essential principles of pocket neighborhood planning and design, and short stories about â€œPocket Neighborhood Pioneersâ€ who blazed new trails. The book is filled with rich photographs, drawings, illustrations and site plans, and a Resources section at the end provides leads for the reader to explore the topic in further detail., Â ","Cities,Urban Planning,Nonfiction,Architecture,Cities,Urbanism,Geography,Cities,Family",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344678814l/10051877.jpg,160085107X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10051877-pocket-neighborhoods,224,Pocket Neighborhoods: Creating Small-Scale Community in a Large-Scale World,127

Jim Igoe,Paperback,"CONSERVATION AND GLOBALIZATION opens with a discussion of these two broad issues as they relate to the author's fieldwork with Maasai herding communities on the margins of Tarangire National Park in Tanzania. It explores different theoretical perspectives (Neo-Marxist and Foucauldian) on globalization and why both are relevant to the case studies presented. Readers are introduced to the practice of multi-sited ethnography and its centrality to the anthropological study of globalization. While drawing on examples from specific Maasai communities, the book is more broadly concerned with the historical and contemporary links between these communities and a global system of institutions, ideas, and money. The ecological incompatibility of Western national park-style conservation with East African savanna ecosystems and Maasai resource management practices, are highlighted. The concept of national parks is traced temporally and geographically from Maasai communities to the enclosure movement in 18th century England and westward expansion in 19th century North America. The relationships of parks to Judeo-Christian assumptions about ""man's place in nature,"" colonial ideologies like Manifest Destiny and the Civilizing Mission, and capitalist notions of private property and ""The Tragedy of the Commons,"" are explored. The book also looks at the latest conservation paradigm of ""Community-Based Conservation,"" and explores its connections to the Soviet Collapse, economic and political liberalization, and the global proliferation of NGOs.","Nonfiction,Anthropology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347899633l/1005204.jpg,534613179,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1005204.Conservation_and_Globalization,200,Conservation and Globalization: A Study of National Parks and Indigenous Communities from East Africa to South Dakota,55

Alcida Rita Ramos,Paperback,"Indigenous people comprise only 0.2% of Brazil's population, yet occupy a prominent role in the nation's consciousness. In her important and passionate new book, anthropologist Alcida Ramos explains this irony, exploring Indian and non-Indian attitudes about interethnic relations. Ramos contends that imagery about indigenous people reflects an ambivalence Brazil has about itself as a nation, for Indians reveal Braziliansâ€™ contradiction between their pride in ethnic pluralism and desire for national homogeneity.,Â Â Â  Based on her more than thirty years of fieldwork and activism on behalf of the Yanomami Indians, Ramos explains the complex ideology called indigenism. She evaluates its meaning through the relations of Brazilian Indians with religious and lay institutions, non-governmental organizations, official agencies such as the National Indian Foundation as well as the very discipline of anthropology. Ramos not only examines the imagery created by Brazilians of European descentâ€”members of the Catholic church, government officials, the army and the state agency for Indian affairsâ€”she also scrutinizes Indians' own self portrayals used in defending their ethnic rights against the Brazilian state. ,Â Â Â  Ramosâ€™ thoughtful and complete analysis of the relation between indigenous people of Brazil and the state will be of great interest to lawmakers and political theorists, environmental and civil rights activists, developmental specialists and policymakers, and those concerned with human rights in Latin America.","Cultural,Brazil",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328828841l/1005276.jpg,299160440,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1005276.Indigenism,368,Indigenism: Ethnic Politics In Brazil,74

"David Shultz,David Wieck",Hardcover,"So much has been written about Gettysburg, goes the well-worn cliche, that there is nothing new left to write. ,The Second Day at Gettysburg: The Attack and Defense of Cemetery Ridge, July 2, 1863,, by David L. Shultz and Scott L. Mingus Sr. aptly demonstrates that there is indeed still much to learn about the war's largest and bloodiest battle.,Based upon a faulty early-morning reconnaissance, General Robert E. Lee decided to attack up the Emmitsburg Road in an effort to collapse the left flank of General George Meade's Army of the Potomac and decisively defeat it. The effort got underway when General James Longstreet's First Corps troops crushed General Sickles' Peach Orchard salient and turned north and east to drive deeply into the Union rear. A third Confederate division under Richard Anderson, part of A. P. Hill's Third Corps, joined in the attack, slamming one brigade after another into the overstretched Union line stitched northward along the Emmitsburg Road. The bloody fighting stair-stepped its way up Cemetery Ridge, tearing open a large gap in the center of the Federal line that threatened to split the Union army in two. The fate of the Battle of Gettysburg hung in the balance.,Despite the importance of the position, surprisingly few Union troops were available to defend the yawning gap on the ridge. Major General Winfield S. Hancock's Second Corps had been reduced to less than one division when his other two were sucked southward to reinforce the collapsing Third Corps front. Reprising Horatio at the Bridge, the gallant commander cobbled together a wide variety of infantry and artillery commands and threw them into the action, refusing to yield even one acre of ground. The long and intense fighting included hand-to-hand combat and the personal heroics of which legends are made.,Veteran Gettysburg authors Shultz and Mingus merge their subject matter expertise and keen understanding of the complex undulating terrain and physical features to produce the most detailed study of this action ever written. In addition to demonstrating how the fighting on the far Union left directly affected the combat to come in the center of General Meade's line, the authors also address some of the most commonly overlooked aspects of the fighting: what routes did some of the key units take to reach the front? What could the commanders actually see, and when could they see it? How did the fences, roads, farms, trees, ravines, creeks, and others obstacles directly affect tactical decisions, and ultimately the battle itself? ,Based upon extensive research and graced with dozens of photographs and detailed original maps, The Second Day at Gettysburg offers a balanced, compelling, and ultimately satisfying account of one of the most overlooked and yet important aspects of the defining battle of the American Civil War.","Military History,Civil War,American Civil War,Civil War Eastern Theater,American History,American Civil War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445791914l/10053258.jpg,1611210747,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10053258-the-second-day-at-gettysburg,550,"The Second Day at Gettysburg: The Attack and Defense of Cemetery Ridge, July 2, 1863",126

Philip Lambert,Hardcover,"In fourteen years of collaboration, composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick wrote seven of Broadway's most beloved and memorable musicals together, most famously ,Fiddler on the Roof, (1964), but also the enduring audience favorite ,She Loves Me, (1963), and the Pulitzer-Prize-winning ,Fiorello!, (1959). With their charm, humor, and boundless musical invention, their musicals have won eighteen Tony Awards and continue to capture the imaginations of millions around the world.,To Broadway, To Life!: The Musical Theater of Bock and Harnick ,is the first complete book about these creative figures, one of Broadway's most important songwriting teams. Drawing from extensive archival sources, and from personal interviews and communications with Bock and Harnick themselves and their most important collaborators, author Philip Lambert explores the essence of a Bock-Harnick show-how it is put together, and what makes it work. The book includes discussion of songs such as Sunrise, Sunset and If I Were a Rich Man that have long been favorites in the public consciousness, and it also explores a vast catalogue of lesser-known songs from their many other shows and works, including a musical puppet show on Broadway, music for the 1964 World's Fair, and a made-for-television musical. Here too is the first look at the little-known youthful professional beginnings of Bock and Harnick in revues and television shows and summer retreats in the 1950s, and the careers they have forged for themselves with new collaborators in the decades since their partnership dissolved in 1970.,The musicals of Bock and Harnick came at a transitional time in Broadway history, when the traditions of Rodgers and Hammerstein were starting to give way to the concept musical, the rock musical, and eventually the mega-musical. ,To Broadway, To Life! ,combines exhaustive research, close musical investigation, and interpretive critical analysis to place Bock and Harnick in the context of these times, and helps establish their place in the history of the American musical theater.","Plays,Theatre",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347235345l/10054585.jpg,195390075,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10054585-to-broadway-to-life,361,"To Broadway, to Life!: The Musical Theater of Bock and Harnick",54
"Oecumenius,Andrew of Caesarea",Hardcover,"The Eastern church gives little evidence of particular interest in the book of Revelation. Oecumenius of Isauria's commentary on the book is the earliest full treatment in Greek and dates only from the early sixth century. Along with Oecumenius's commentary, only that of Andrew of Caesarea (dating from the same era and often summarizing Oecumenius before offering a contrary opinion) and that of Arethas of Caesarea four centuries later provide any significant commentary from within the Greek tradition. William Weinrich renders a particular service to readers interested in ancient commentary on the Apocalypse by translating in one volume the two early sixth-century commentaries. Because of the two interpreters' often differing understandings, readers are exposed not only to early dialogue on the meaning and significance of the book for the faith and life of the church, but also to breadth of interpretation within the unity of the faith the two shared.","Christianity,New Testament",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348968185l/10054658.jpg,830829083,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10054658-greek-commentaries-on-revelation,212,Greek Commentaries on Revelation,93

Mark Monmonier,Paperback,"Originally published to wide acclaim, this lively, cleverly illustrated essay on the use and abuse of maps teaches us how to evaluate maps critically and promotes a healthy skepticism about these easy-to-manipulate models of reality. Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.,The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.,To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.,""Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space.""â€”,Scientific American,""A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted.

Dorothy Roberts,Hardcover,"A decade after the Human Genome Project proved that human beings are not naturally divided by race, the emerging fields of personalized medicine, reproductive technologies, genetic genealogy, and DNA databanks are attempting to resuscitate race as a biological category written in our genes. In this provocative analysis, leading legal scholar and social critic Dorothy Roberts argues that America is once again at the brink of a virulent outbreak of classifying population by race. By searching for differences at the molecular level, a new race-based science is obscuring racism in our society and legitimizing state brutality against communities of color at a time when America claims to be post-racial.,Moving from an account of the evolution of raceâ€”proving that it has always been a mutable and socially defined political division supported by mainstream scienceâ€”Roberts delves deep into the current debates, interrogating the newest science and biotechnology, interviewing its researchers, and exposing the political consequences obscured by the focus on genetic difference. ,Fatal Invention, is a provocative call for us to affirm our common humanity.","Nonfiction,Race,Science,Race,Anti Racist,Politics,Social Movements,Social Justice,History,Sociology,Health,Medicine,Economics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328751704l/10055524.jpg,1595584951,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10055524-fatal-invention,400,"Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-First Century",103
John W. Dower,Hardcover,"Remembering and reconstructing the past inevitably involves forgettingâ€”and nowhere more so than in the complex relationship between the United States and Japan since the end of World War II. In this provocative and probing series of essays, John W. Dowerâ€”one of our leading historians of postwar Japan and author of the Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning ,Embracing Defeat,â€”explores the uses and abuses to which this history has been subjected and, with deliberation and insight, affirms the urgent need for scholars to ask the questions that are not being asked.,Taking as a starting point the work of E.H. Norman, the unjustly neglected historian of prewar Japan, ,Ways of Forgetting, Ways of Remembering, sets out both to challenge historiographical orthodoxy and reveal the configurations of power inherent in scholarly and popular discourse in Japan and America. Dowerâ€™s fascination with capturing popular experience leads to sources as far ranging as textiles adorned with wartime propaganda and the satirical cartoon panels that decorate traditional karuta playing cards. Dower, who is rightly known as one of the most perceptive critics of American foreign policy, also offers a blistering critique of the U.S. occupation of Iraq and the misuse of postwar Japan as an example of success.,Ways of Forgetting, Ways of Remembering, is a profound look at American and Japanese perceptionsâ€”past and presentâ€”of key moments in their shared history. An incisive investigation of the problems of public history and its role in a modern democracy, these essays are essential reading for anyone interested in postwar U.S.-Japan relations, as well as the broader discipline of history.","Cultural,Japan,History,Nonfiction,Writing,Essays,Cultural,Asia,Politics,History,Japanese History,War,World War II,Literature,Asian Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344719892l/10055561.jpg,1595586180,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10055561-ways-of-forgetting-ways-of-remembering,336,"Ways of Forgetting, Ways of Remembering: Japan in the Modern World",90

"Erica Chenoweth,Maria J. Stephan",Hardcover,"For more than a century, from 1900 to 2006, campaigns of nonviolent resistance were more than twice as effective as their violent counterparts in achieving their stated goals. By attracting impressive support from citizens, whose activism takes the form of protests, boycotts, civil disobedience, and other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, these efforts help separate regimes from their main sources of power and produce remarkable results, even in Iran, Burma, the Philippines, and the Palestinian Territories.,Combining statistical analysis with case studies of specific countries and territories, Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan detail the factors enabling such campaigns to succeed and, sometimes, causing them to fail. They find that nonviolent resistance presents fewer obstacles to moral and physical involvement and commitment, and that higher levels of participation contribute to enhanced resilience, greater opportunities for tactical innovation and civic disruption (and therefore less incentive for a regime to maintain its status quo), and shifts in loyalty among opponents' erstwhile supporters, including members of the military establishment.,Chenoweth and Stephan conclude that successful nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and internally peaceful democracies, which are less likely to regress into civil war. Presenting a rich, evidentiary argument, they originally and systematically compare violent and nonviolent outcomes in different historical periods and geographical contexts, debunking the myth that violence occurs because of structural and environmental factors and that it is necessary to achieve certain political goals. Instead, the authors discover, violent insurgency is rarely justifiable on strategic grounds.","Politics,Nonfiction,History,Social Issues,Activism,Politics,Political Science,Sociology,Social Movements,Social Justice,Social Justice,Social Change,Social Science,Academic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1310471060l/10056014.jpg,231156820,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10056014-why-civil-resistance-works,320,Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict,15

Bill Lucas,Paperback,"Lucas offers a revolutionary understanding of how mankinds brains are pre-wired to learn and the practical steps to take in order to participate fully in the process.,Bill Lucas, a leading international expert on life-long learning, shows that while we have learned more about how the brain works in the last decade than we have ever known, only a fraction of this is grasped and applied by most people. Power Up Your Mind applies this practical knowledge for the first time and shows you how to learn. Drawing on research from a wide variety of subject areas, from neuroscience to psychology, from motivation theory to accelerated learning, from memory to diet, this book shows how everyone has the capacity to succeed and how most people use only a very small portion of their talents. For learning to be effective, an understanding of how the brain works is essential and unlike most of the recent thinking on the mind, Lucas connects an understanding of the brain with the reality of the workplace and translates what we know about the brain into useful insights for work. Much work-based training is a waste of time and money because the majority of people are neither emotionally ready nor practically inclined to apply their learning to the way they behave.

"James D. Bradley,Ron Powers",Paperback,"In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will of America.,In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jimaâ€”and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades, they battled to the island's highest peak. And after climbing through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag.,Now the son of one of the flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came together in a moment that will live forever.,To his family, John Bradley never spoke of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered closed boxes of letters and photos. In ,Flags of Our Fathers,, James Bradley draws on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company. Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial islandâ€”an island riddled with Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man.,But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory. The men in the photoâ€”three were killed during the battleâ€”were proclaimed heroes and flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering. Only James Bradley's father truly survived, displaying no copy of the famous photograph in his home, telling his son only: ""The real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who didn't come back."",Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war and its aftermath as well as ,Flags of Our Fathers,. A penetrating, epic look at a generation at war, this is history told with keen insight, enormous honesty, and the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human experience of war.,From the Hardcover edition.","History,Nonfiction,War,Military Fiction,War,War,World War II,Biography,Military,Military History,North American Hi...,American History,Historical,Adult",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386923564l/10058.jpg,553384155,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10058.Flags_of_Our_Fathers,382,Flags of Our Fathers,92

Patrick S. Cheng,Paperback,"Contextual theologies have developed from a number of perspectives including feminist theology, Black theology, womanist theology, Latin American liberation theology, and Asian American theology and a wide variety of academic and general introductions exist to examine each one.,However, ,Radical Love, is the first introductory textbook on the subject of queer theology.,Queer theology is concerned with questions about the meaning of existence, as posed by lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual, and other queer seekers. The classic problems of theology apply: the problems of both natural and human evil; the problem of God, or the ultimate source of the universe; the problem of the purpose of human life; the problem of ethical conduct; and the problem of human desire for eternal life.,Part One of this new book provides a historical survey of how queer theology has developed from the 1950's to today. Part Two is a substantive, but highly readable introduction to the themes of queer theology using the ecumenical creeds as a general framework. Topics include revelation, God, Trinity, creation, Jesus Christ, atonement, sin, grace, Holy Spirit, church, sacraments, and last things, as seen through the lenses of LGBT,theologians.","Religion,Theology,Religion,GLBT,Queer,LGBT,Nonfiction,Religion,Christianity,Christian,Sexuality,Religion,Faith,Spirituality",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421709272l/10059955.jpg,1596271329,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10059955-radical-love,161,Radical Love: An Introduction to Queer Theology,9

G. John Ikenberry,Hardcover,"In the second half of the twentieth century, the United States engaged in the most ambitious and far-reaching liberal order building the world had yet seen. This liberal international order has been one of the most successful in history in providing security and prosperity to more people. But in the last decade, the American-led order has been troubled. Some argue that the Bush administration, with its war on terror, invasion of Iraq, and unilateral orientation, undermined this liberal order. Others argue that we are witnessing the end of the American era. ,Liberal Leviathan, engages these debates., G. John Ikenberry argues that the crisis that besets the American-led order is a crisis of authority. A political struggle has been ignited over the distribution of roles, rights, and authority within the liberal international order. But the deeper logic of liberal order remains alive and well. The forces that have triggered this crisis--the rise of non-Western states such as China, contested norms of sovereignty, and the deepening of economic and security interdependence--have resulted from the successful functioning and expansion of the postwar liberal order, not its breakdown. The liberal international order has encountered crises in the past and evolved as a result. It will do so again., Ikenberry provides the most systematic statement yet about the theory and practice of the liberal international order, and a forceful message for policymakers, scholars, and general readers about why America must renegotiate its relationship with the rest of the world and pursue a more enlightened strategy--that of the liberal leviathan.","Politics,History,Political Science,International Relations,Politics,Political Science,Nonfiction,Academic,School",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391303816l/10060194.jpg,691125589,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10060194-liberal-leviathan,392,"Liberal Leviathan: The Origins, Crisis, and Transformation of the American World Order",88

Herman Brusselmans,Paperback,"'Ex drummer' is het slotdeel van de 'Ex-trilogie', die verder bestaat uit 'Ex schrijver' en 'Ex minnaar' en behoort tot het allerbeste van Herman Brusselmans' omvangrijke oeuvre. In deze hilarische studie van verloedering worden drie onverbeterlijke losers ten tonele gevoerd, die een populaire schrijver engageren als drummer voor hun rockgroepje. De baldadige avonturen van The Feminists, 'de slechtste band die Gent ooit gekend heeft', worden door Brusselman met de gebruikelijke overdrijving en absurditeit neergezet, maar tussen alle mafkezerij door is er opvallend veel plaats voor gevoeligheid en melancholie. En zo wordt er exuberant gesnoven en gescholden, gevochten en gemoord, geneuzeld en geneukt - tot de even onvermijdelijke als verstrekkende conclusie: 'Alles blijft continu onbegrijpelijk, vunzig, in wezen onmenselijk.'","Fiction,European Literature,Dutch Literature,Literature,Humor,Novels,European Literature,Belgian,Anthologies,Collections,Culture,Film,Literature,20th Century",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1472393546l/1006061.jpg,9053332561,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006061.Ex_drummer,176,Ex-drummer,3

At the heart of the book, award-winning wine writer Stephen Brook offers 90 intimate profiles of top producersâ€”from Napa and Sonoma to the North and Central coasts, the Sierra foothills, and beyond. Brook also includes general information on California wine history, wine culture, grape varieties, and more. Throughout, he searches for the characteristics that make California wine distinctive despite its tremendous diversityâ€”and finds the answer in the stateâ€™s unusual climate, especially the shifting interplay between fog and sun, as well as a lively and constant questioning of received ideas about viticulture, vine age, terroir, and winemaking techniques, all of which have helped winemakers to create complexity,individuality, and nuance in their wines.","Alcohol,Wine",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348556441l/10060915.jpg,520266587,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10060915-the-finest-wines-of-california,320,The Finest Wines of California: A Regional Guide to the Best Producers and Their Wines,59

Luke Williams,Hardcover,"An evocative and exquisitely written debut novel about family, empire and money. , , Impressive in its scope and ambition, this first novel is at once a family saga, a book that reimagines the myth of the empire, and a history of objects. ,The Echo Chamber, is narrated by fifty-four- year-old Evie Steppman, who grew up in Nigeria in the 1950s during the last decade of British rule. As a child, Evie exhibited extraordinarily acute powers of hearing; now, alone in an attic in Scotland that is filled with objects from her past and with her powers of hearing starting to fade, she sets out to record her history before it all disintegrates into a meaningless din. Tales of the twelfth-century mapmaker in Palermo, stories whispered by embittered expatriates, and eyewitness accounts from Nigeria's civil war mingle with Evie's memories of her childhood, of her grandfather, a watchmaker who attempted to forge a mechanical likeness of his dead wife, and of her travels across America. Williams's interest in history and storytelling and his talent for evoking multiple voices will remind readers of the work of David Mitchell, Peter Carey, and Jonathan Safran Foer.","Fiction,Western Africa,Nigeria,Historical,Historical Fiction,European Literature,British Literature,Literary Fiction,Cultural,Scotland",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1310828709l/10061270.jpg,670022837,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10061270-the-echo-chamber,384,The Echo Chamber,122

Paul Rivlin,Paperback,"This book analyzes the development of the Israeli economy in its historical context. It shows how the ideology of the dominant group in the Zionist movement led to the development of agriculture, thus meeting the preconditions for successful industrialization.

Regional isolation led to the emphasis on high-quality exports for developed markets that has stimulated the technological base. Israel has benefited from mass immigration and increased access to foreign capital, factors that have transformed the economy.

Rosalyn Schanzer,Paperback,"Catch the fever! Gold fever swept the nationâ€”and the worldâ€”in 1848 when carpenter James Marshall discovered a gold nugget in the American River near John Sutter's mill. As word spread of gold in California, the news set off a westward stampede. Fortune seekers and adventurers poured into California by land and sea, wild with excitement and expectation. ,Rosalyn Schanzer's engaging and humorous book tells the story of these prospectors in their own words. Schanzer has gathered her favorite quotes from journals and letters written by the forty-niners to recount the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill. Her irresistible narrative also uses newspaper accounts to trace the various routes the forty-niners took from the East Coast to the West, the adventures they experienced along the way, and the challenges they faced on arrival. The characters recount their stories in their own words, in well-researched and authenticated quote bubbles. ,Step into an intensely exciting chapter of American history. Learn about the dreamers who dropped everything to head out west. See who found gold and how. Meet the lucky onesâ€”and the many whose dreams turned to dust. Listen to the intriguing tales of the prospectors, and find out what the gold-diggers did with their newfound wealth. ,To write and research ,Gold Fever!,, Rosalyn Schanzer visited many California Gold Rush historical sites, and took more than 600 photographs of everything from gold nuggets to saloons in order to make her art as accurate and flavorful as possible.

Dalai Lama XIV,Paperback,"Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Niels Bohr, Einstein. Their insights shook our perception of who we are and where we stand in the world, and in their wake have left an uneasy coexistence: science vs. religion, faith vs. empirical inquiry. Which is the keeper of truth? Which is the true path to understanding reality?,After forty years of study with some of the greatest scientific minds, as well as a lifetime of meditative, spiritual, and philosophic study, the Dalai Lama presents a brilliant analysis of why all avenues of inquiryâ€”scientific as well as spiritualâ€”must be pursued in order to arrive at a complete picture of the truth. Through an examination of Darwinism and karma, quantum mechanics and philosophical insight into the nature of reality, neurobiology and the study of consciousness, the Dalai Lama draws significant parallels between contemplative and scientific examinations of reality.,This breathtakingly personal examination is a tribute to the Dalai Lamaâ€™s teachersâ€”both of science and spirituality.

Although the aims of this compelling, compassionate work are broadly cultural and literary, the narrative is rooted in personal experience: it begins with a long memoir of Sylvia Plath, and ends with an account of the author's own suicide attempt. Within this dramatic framework, Alvarez launches his enquiry into the final taboo of human behavior, and traces changing attitudes towards suicide from the perspective of literature.

Colin Tudge,Hardcover,"Here, between the covers of one capacious book, is an illustrated summary of all the creatures that have ever lived, a vast compendium of earth's current and former inhabitants in all their dazzling and infinite diversity., Colin Tudge argues that we are entering a new phase of biology in which, for the first time, biologists are achieving profound insight into life's true diversity and developing the tools to keep track of it. The Variety of Life heralds this new phase. The first part of the book describes why biologists now feel that there could have been as many as 4,000 billion species on Earth since life began. It then discusses the need for classification, beginning with the most basic principles--the strictly practical classification of fishmongers and foresters, who speak of ""shellfish"" and differentiate ""hardwood"" from ""softwood""--and moves on to explore the intriguing deliberations of the modern ""transformed cladists"" and the novel contributions of molecular genetics. Part II describes the creatures themselves. It is divided into 24 sections, each describing a different group, illustrated by nearly 50 double-page spreads which present genealogical ""trees"" that summarize the evolutionary relationships between the creatures in each group. Some sections describe large, comprehensive groups such as the kingdoms of the Animals or the Plants. Others treat similar sub-groups in more detail, such as the Mammals, a class, or the Hominids, a family. In lively and accessible prose, all the significant groups of creatures--both alive and extinct--are described and their relationships clarified., For general readers and serious biologists alike, The Variety of Life offers an unprecedented storehouse of knowledge of life on earth.","Science,Science,Biology,Nonfiction,Biology,Evolution,Environment,Nature,Science,Natural History,History,Animals,Reference,Science Nature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346825788l/1006325.jpg,198503113,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006325.The_Variety_of_Life,684,The Variety of Life: A Survey and a Celebration of All the Creatures that Have Ever Lived,127

Stephen James O'Meara,Hardcover,"For more than two centuries, amateur astronomers have earned their stripes by observing the 109 star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies cataloged by French comet hunter Charles Messier. Sir Patrick Moore has compiled a new list of 109 deep-sky delights, the Caldwell Catalog, which covers the entire celestial sphere. Stephen James O'Meara has observed all 109 Caldwell objects and Deep Sky Companions presents his beautiful sketches and detailed visual descriptions and discusses each object's rich history and astrophysical significance. The latest fundamental data on each object are tabulated, and the book's star charts will lead observers to each object's precise location. Stephen James O'Meara is known worldwide for his precise drawings of astronomical objects as seen through the telescope. Among his many astronomical achievements, he was the first to sight Halley's Comet on its 1985 return; he noticed the dark spokes in Saturn's B ring before the Voyager 1 spacecraft imaged them; and he was the first person to determine the rotation period of the distant planet Uranus. The International Astronomical Union named asteroid 3637 O'Meara in his honor. He is also the author of Deep Sky Companions: The Messier Objects (Cambridge, 1998) and co-author with his wife, Donna Donovan O'Meara, of Volcanoes: Passion and Fury (Sky Publishing, 1994).","Science,Astronomy,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348770873l/1006408.jpg,521827965,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006408.Deep_Sky_Companions,500,Deep-Sky Companions: The Caldwell Objects,58

Stephen Brumwell,Paperback,"This book examines the experiences of the British Army soldiers, or 'redcoats', who fought in North America and the West Indies between 1755 and 1763. It explores the Army's distinctive society, using new evidence to provide a voice for ordinary soldiers who have previously been ignored by historians. While other books on the period concentrate upon major personalities and events, this study examines events from the perspective of the individual: the experience of combat, captivity among the Indians, the Army's women and the fate of veterans. Stephen Brumwell is a former newspaper journalist and Lecturer in Modern History at the University of Leeds and now works as a freelance writer.

Lawrence M. Krauss,Paperback,"Will the universe continue to expand forever, reverse its expansion and begin to contract, or reach a delicately poised state where it simply persists forever? The answer depends on the amount and properties of matter in the universe, and that has given rise to one of the great paradoxes of modern cosmology: there is too little visible matter to account for the behavior we can see. Over ninety percent of the universe consists of ""missing mass"" or ""dark matter"" - what Lawrence Krauss, in his classic book, termed ""the fifth essence.""In this new edition of T ,he Fifth Essence, , retitled ,Quintessence, after the now widely accepted term for dark matter, Krauss shows how the dark matter problem is now connected with two of the hottest areas in recent cosmology: the fate of the universe and the ""cosmological constant."" With a new introduction, epilogue, and chapter updates, Krauss updates his classic for 1999 and shares one of the most stunning discoveries of recent years: an anti-gravity force that explains recent observations of a permanently expanding universe.","Science,Science,Physics,Nonfiction,Science,Astronomy,Science,Popular Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348681883l/100645.jpg,465037410,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100645.Quintessence,384,Quintessence: The Mystery of Missing Mass in the Universe,25

Michael Bronski,Hardcover,"Winner of a 2012 Stonewall Book Award in nonfiction,The first book to cover the entirety of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history, from pre-1492 to the present.,In the 1620s, Thomas Morton broke from Plymouth Colony and founded Merrymount, which celebrated same-sex desire, atheism, and interracial marriage. Transgender evangelist Jemima Wilkinson, in the early 1800s, changed her name to â€œPublick Universal Friend,â€ refused to use pronouns, fought for gender equality, and led her own congregation in upstate New York. In the mid-nineteenth century, internationally famous Shakespearean actor Charlotte Cushman led an openly lesbian life, including a well-publicized â€œfemale marriage.â€ And in the late 1920s, Augustus Granville Dill was fired by W. E. B. Du Bois from the NAACPâ€™s magazine the ,Crisis, after being arrested for a homosexual encounter. These are just a few moments of queer history that Michael Bronski highlights in this groundbreaking book. , Â , Intellectually dynamic and endlessly provocative, ,A Queer History of the United States, is more than a â€œwhoâ€™s whoâ€ of queer history: it is a book that radically challenges how we understand American history. Drawing upon primary documents, literature, and cultural histories, noted scholar and activist Michael Bronski charts the breadth of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history, from 1492 to the 1990s, and has written a testament to how the LGBT experience has profoundly shaped our country, culture, and history. , Â ,A Queer History of the United States, abounds with startling examples of unknown or often ignored aspects of American historyâ€”the ineffectiveness of sodomy laws in the colonies, the prevalence of cross-dressing women soldiers in the Civil War, the impact of new technologies on LGBT life in the nineteenth century, and how rock music and popular culture were, in large part, responsible for the devastating backlash against gay rights in the late 1970s. Most striking, Bronski documents how, over centuries, various incarnations of social purity movements have consistently attempted to regulate all sexuality, including fantasies, masturbation, and queer sex. Resisting these efforts, same-sex desire flourished and helped make America what it is today. , Â , At heart, ,A Queer History of the United States, is simply about American history. It is a book that will matter both to LGBT people and heterosexuals. This engrossing and revelatory history will make readers appreciate just how queer America really is.

Eva Wong,Paperback,"Here, Taoist practitioner Eva Wong offers a colorful treatment of the history and evolution of Taoism, told through traditional teaching tales. These tales, which Wong first heard as a child growing up in Hong Kong, are gleaned from the local storytellers and the uncensored chronicles known as ,yeshi,â€”the wild history of China, not monitored by the official imperial scholars and historians. The stories are by turns mysterious and intriguing, passionate and violent, and they are peppered with colorful characters, including hermits, politicians, social activists, revolutionaries, scholars, scientists, and mystics.,Arranged chronologically from prehistory through the early twentieth century, these stories introduce the schools in the Taoist lineages, and capture the defeats and victories of Taoism, its periods of decadence and decay, and its renewal, maturation, and spiritual triumph.

Encompassing several geographically distinctive regions, from the 6,000-foot peaks of the Unaka Mountains to the swampy floodplain of the Mississippi River, the state boasts nearly 3,000 native plant species.

Beginning with a survey of the stateâ€™s ecologyâ€”including geology, geography, plant life and animal speciesâ€”Hunter takes a holistic approach to the process of gardening with native plants. The bookâ€™s main section provides detailed accounts of 450 species of wildflowers, ferns, grasses, vines, shrubs, and trees native to Tennessee and adjacent states. These descriptions, arranged according to plant type, include both scientific and common name, flowering and fruiting times, propagation methods, soil and light requirements, and distribution patterns within the state. Nearly 400 color photographs illustrate the species discussions.,No other book designed for the home gardener includes such area-specific information on native species or such a comprehensive listing of plants. Appendixes refer readers to other sources of information and seeds, including mail-order nurseries, botanical gardens, state agencies, native plant organizations, and subject-specific conferences.

Examining Spainâ€™s unique role in the larger history of Western Europe, Payne reinterprets key aspects of the countryâ€™s history.,Â Â  Â Topics include Muslim culture in the peninsula, the Spanish monarchy, the empire, and the relationship between Spain and Portugal. Turning to the twentieth century, Payne discusses the Second Republic and the Spanish Civil War. The bookâ€™s final chapters focus on the Franco regime, the nature of Spanish fascism, and the special role of the military. Analyzing the figure of Franco himself, Payne seeks to explain why some Spaniards still regard him with respect, while many others view the late dictator with profound loathing.,Â Â  Â Framed by reflections on the authorâ€™s own formation as a Hispanist and his evaluation of the controversy about â€œhistorical memoryâ€ in contemporary Spain, this volume offers deeply informed insights into both the history and the historiography of a unique country.,A, Choice ,Outstanding Academic Book,Best Books for General Audiences, selected by the Public Library Association","History,Cultural,Spain,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328827354l/10066326.jpg,299250245,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10066326-spain,326,Spain: A Unique History,67

William Stevenson,Unknown Binding,"The incredible story of an Israeli mission that rescued 103 hostages from a hijacked jetliner.,On June 27, 1976, Air France Flight 139 was hijacked by terrorists and flown to Entebbe Airport in Uganda. In the following agonizing days, Israeli passengers were singled out and held hostage. A week later on July 4, one hundred Israeli commandos raced 2,500 miles from Israel to Entebbe, landed in the middle of the night, and in a heart-stopping mission that lasted ninety minutes, killed all guerillas and freed 103 hostages.,In captivating detail, Stevenson provides a fast-paced hour-by-hour narration from the hijacking to the final ninety-minute mission. In addition to discussing the incredible rescue itself, Stevenson also covers the political backdrop behind the hijacking, especially Ugandan President Idi Aminâ€™s support for the hijackers, which marked one of the first times a leader of a nation had backed terrorist activities. An illustration of one nationâ€™s undying spirit, heroism, and commitment to its people in the face of threat, Operation Thunderbolt has become a legendary antiterrorist tale.,Although first written in 1976 (and published within weeks of the event), Stevensonâ€™s account presents this act of terrorism in a way that is still relevant in our modern-day political climate. A factual account of what could easily be read as sensational fiction, ,90 Minutes at Entebbe, will inspire, encourage, and instill hope in all readers.,Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

In this book, he reveals the evolution, finances, and inner tensions of the whistleblower organization, beginning with his first meeting with Assange in December 2007. He also describes what led to his September 2010 withdrawal from WikiLeaks, including his disenchantment with the organizationâ€™s lack of transparency, its abandonment of political neutrality, and Assangeâ€™s increasing concentration of power. What has been made public so far about WikiLeaks is only a small fraction of the truth. With Domscheit-Bergâ€™s insider knowledge, he is uniquely able to tell the full story. A computer scientist who worked in IT security prior to devoting himself full-time to WikiLeaks, he remains committed to freedom of information on the Internet. Today he is working on a more transparent secret-sharing website called OpenLeaks, developed by former WikiLeaks people, to be launched in early 2011.","Nonfiction,Politics,Science,Technology,History,Biography,Autobiography,Memoir,Writing,Journalism,Computers,Internet,Contemporary,Biography Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320553487l/10068893.jpg,030795191X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10068893-inside-wikileaks,304,Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website,59
Stephen Baxter,Paperback,"Even as a young calf, Longtusk understood the hardships the few remaining of his ancient kind had encountered when the glaciers retreated and grassy forests stole over the vast tundra the herds called home. Worst of all was when the Fireheads came -- cruel, two-legged beasts who kill for pleasure. At a tender age, Longtusk became their prisoner -- hobbled, abused, and stripped of his freedom. But through toil and terror, Longtusk never forgot his Clan -- and he learned crucial, intimate knowledge of the Fireheads' ways, though at a terrible price. Now the time is rapidly approaching when he will have to clash with those who seek to destroy every living trace of his proud breed. And Longtusk must not shun the twisted path in front of him or what he is destined to become: the greatest hero of them all.","Science Fiction,Fiction,Fantasy,Animals,Historical,Historical Fiction,Historical Fiction,Prehistoric,Animals,Animal Fiction,Science Fiction Fantasy,Adventure,Animals,Anthropomorphic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351368246l/100688.jpg,61051357,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100688.Longtusk,320,Longtusk,41

Colin Tudge,Hardcover,"Tradition has it that agriculture began in the Middle East around 10,000 years ago, that once people realized the advantages of farming, it spread rapidly to the furthest outposts of the world, and that this led to the Neolithic Revolution and the end of the hunting-gathering lifestyle. In this book Colin Tudge argues that agriculture in some form was in the repertoire of our ancestors for thousands of years before the Neolithic farming revolution: people did not suddenly invent forced into it over a long period. What we see in the Neolithic Revolution is not the beginning of agriculture on a large scale, in one place, with refined tools.,Drawing on a wide range of evidence from fossil records to the Bible, Tudge offers a persuasive hypothesis about a puzzling epoch in our past. In so doing, he provides new insights into the Pleistocene overkill, the demise of the Neanderthals, the location of the biblical Eden, and much more.","History,Science,Anthropology,Nonfiction,History,Prehistory,Science,Agriculture",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347292428l/1007157.jpg,300080247,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007157.Neanderthals_Bandits_and_Farmers,64,"Neanderthals, Bandits and Farmers: How Agriculture Really Began",3

Tudge is a Cambridge zoology graduate who has worked as a science journalist and has written several well known and very successful books on agriculture and conservation (such as,Food Crops for the Future,), genetics (,In Mendel's Footnotes,) and evolution (,The Variety of Life,). ,So Shall We Reap, combines all these strands in an impassioned plea for global change in current farming practice. Tudge argues that at present there are good reasons for thinking we are getting it wrong. For instance, one of the most glaring and obscene disparities is that while famine is common, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the developed world has food surpluses and is suffering from what the World Health Organisation calls a ""global epidemic"" of obesity. , Tudge examines the nature of the problem, then castigates the main players--the agribusiness, the bio technicians and other scientists who have been seduced by the lure of big bucks and quick fixes and then embarks on his own solution, what he calls ""Enlightened Agriculture""--appealing to the better use of some basic rules of biology and ecological models and the development of more labour intensive mixed economies which will help maintain rural society.

R.K. Narayan,Paperback,"""There are writersâ€”Tolstoy and Henry James to name twoâ€”whom we hold in awe, writersâ€”Turgenev and Chekhovâ€”for whom we feel a personal affection, other writers whom we respectâ€”Conrad for exampleâ€”but who hold us at a long arm's length with their 'courtly foreign grace.' Narayan (whom I don't hesitate to name in such a context) more than any of them wakes in me a spring of gratitude, for he has offered me a second home. Without him I could never have known what it is like to be Indian.""â€”Graham Greene,Offering rare insight into the complexities of Indian middle-class society, R. K.

In ,Mr. Sampath,, a newspaper man tries to keep his paper afloat in the face of social and economic changes sweeping India. Narayan writes of youth and young adulthood in the semiautobiographical ,Swami and Friends, and ,The Bachelor of Arts., Although the ordinary tensions of maturing are heightened by the particular circumstances of pre-partition India, Narayan provides a universal vision of childhood, early love and grief.,""The experience of reading one of his novels is . . . comparable to one's first reaction to the great Russian novels: the fresh realization of the common humanity of all peoples, underlain by a simultaneous sense of strangenessâ€”like one's own reflection seen in a green twilight.""â€”Margaret Parton, ,New York Herald Tribune","Fiction,Cultural,India,Asian Literature,Indian Literature,Classics,Novels,Humor,Literature,Drama,Historical,Historical Fiction,Cultural,Asia",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328872383l/1007172.jpg,226568334,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007172.The_Bachelor_of_Arts,266,The Bachelor of Arts,33

Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives. ,In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances. ,Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, ,A Long Way Down, is a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life. ,What's your jumping-off point? ,Maureen,Why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me, I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong. ,Martin,I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed."" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right. ,Jess,I was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously. ,JJ,New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake). If anybody had been on the roof on either of those nights, the chances are they would have been like-minded souls, rather than hopeless f*ck-ups who had somehow persuaded themselves that the end of a calendar year is in any way significant.","Fiction,Contemporary,Humor,Novels,European Literature,British Literature,Adult Fiction,Adult,Audiobook,Health,Mental Health,Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1467861525l/10073._SX318_.jpg,1594481938,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10073.A_Long_Way_Down,368,A Long Way Down,118

Originally delivered as the Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898, ,Reasoning and the Logic of Things, is the most accessible and thorough introduction to Peirce's mature thought to be found within the compass of a single book.,Beginning with an explanation of the nature of philosophy, Peirce proceeds to illustrate his claim that mathematics provides the foundation of our logic and metaphysics. We find here the clearest formulation of an idea present in Peirce's thought since the 1860s, the distinction between three kinds of reasoning: induction, deduction, and retroduction. Then follows an introduction to Peirce's chief logical doctrines, as well as his attempts to provide a classification of the sciences, a theory of categories, and a theory of science. In conclusion, turning from ""reasoning"" to the ""logic of things,"" Peirce called for an evolutionary cosmology to explain the reality of laws and described the kinds of reasoning he employed in developing this cosmology.,At the urging of his friend William James, Peirce made an uncharacteristic effort in these lectures to present his ideas in terms intelligible to a general audience--those without advanced training in logic and philosophy. The introductory materials by Kenneth Ketner and Hilary Putman add to the volume's lucidity. Consequently, this book will be a valuable source for readers outside of the circle of Peirce specialists.","Philosophy,Philosophy,Logic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349053301l/1007468.jpg,674749677,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007468.Reasoning_and_the_Logic_of_Things,312,Reasoning and the Logic of Things: The Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898,123

Anabel HernÃ¡ndez,Paperback,"Los seÃ±ores del narco es una descarnada crÃ³nica sobre las alarmantes complicidades de los altos cÃ­rculos polÃ­ticos, policiacos, militares y empresariales con el crimen organizado. Anabel HernÃ¡ndez tuvo acceso no sÃ³lo a una vasta documentaciÃ³n, inÃ©dita hasta hoy, sino a testimonios directos de autoridades y expertos en el tema, asÃ­ como de personas involucradas con los principales cÃ¡rteles mexicanos de la droga. Esto le ha permitido examinar rigurosamente el origen de la sangrienta lucha por el poder entre los grupos criminales, y cuestionar la ""guerra"" del gobierno federal contra la delincuencia organizada. Al investigar las intrincadas redes de contubernios, la autora tuvo que remontarse a la dÃ©cada de 1970, cuando se controlaba el trÃ¡fico de enervantes haciendo que los narcos prÃ¡cticamente pagaran impuestos al gobierno. En su inquietante recorrido avanza hacia los aÃ±os ochenta, cuando los jefes de la organizaciÃ³n criminal del PacÃ­fico, auspiciados por la CIA, incursionaron en el jugoso negocio de la cocaÃ­na, y nos conduce hasta el surgimiento de poderosos capos como los hermanos BeltrÃ¡n Leyva, Ismael El Mayo Zambada o JoaquÃ­n GuzmÃ¡n Loera, quienes lograron penetrar las estructuras del Estado y ponerlas a su servicio. Tras echar abajo el mito de la fuga de El Chapo de la prisiÃ³n de Puente Grande en un carrito de lavanderÃ­a, este libro narra su ascenso en la jerarquÃ­a del crimen y cÃ³mo ha llevado hasta sus Ãºltimas y terribles consecuencias un ""pacto de impunidad"" con numerosos funcionarios pÃºblicos y hombres de negocios. Este libro, en suma, se presenta como un impactante viaje al interior del mundo del narcotrÃ¡fico para buscar los poderosos resortes que lo mueven, y los ha descubierto con nombre y apellido.","Nonfiction,History,Politics,Mystery,Crime,Writing,Journalism,Crime,True Crime,Historical,Biography,War,Cultural",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340760267l/10074858.jpg,607310104X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10074858-los-se-ores-del-narco,592,Los seÃ±ores del narco,80

Stephen Holloway,Paperback,"This third edition of Straight and Level thoroughly updates the previous edition with extensive comments on recent industry developments and emerging business models. The discussion is illustrated by current examples drawn from all sectors of the industry and every region of the world. The fundamental structure of earlier editions, now widely used as a framework for air transport management courses, nonetheless remains unchanged. Part 1 of the book provides a strategic context within which to consider the industry's economics. Part 2 is built around a simple yet powerful model that relates operating revenue to operating cost; it examines the most important elements in demand and traffic, price and yield, output and unit cost. Part 3 probes more deeply into three critical aspects of capacity management: network management; fleet management; and revenue management. Part 4 concludes the book by exploring relationships between unit revenue, unit cost, yield, and load factor. Straight and Level has been written primarily for masters-level students on aviation management courses. The book should also be useful to final year undergraduates wanting to prepare for more advanced study. Amongst practitioners, it will appeal to established managers moving from functional posts into general management. More broadly, anyone with knowledge of the airline industry who wants to gain a deeper understanding of its economics at a practical level and an insight into the reasons for its financial volatility should find the book of interest.",Aviation,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347753155l/10074998.jpg,754672581,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10074998-straight-and-level,587,Straight and Level: Practical Airline Economics,63
"Fran Ross,Harryette Mullen",Paperback,"One of a few works of satire written by African American women, ,Oreo, is an uproariously funny novel about relations between African Americans and Jews. It is as fresh and outrageous today as when it was first published in 1974.,Born of a Jewish father and black mother, Oreo grows up in Philadelphia with her grandparents while her mother tours with a theatrical group. Soon after puberty Oreo heads for New York to search for her father, but in the big city she discovers that there are dozens of Sam Schwartzes. Oreo's mission turns into a wickedly humorous picaresque quest, reminiscent of the ancient Greek myth of Theseus.

Leonard Shlain,Paperback,"Why did big-brained ,Homo sapiens, suddenly emerge some 150,000 years ago? The key, according to Leonard Shlain, is female sexuality. Drawing on an awesome breadth of research, he shows how, long ago, the narrowness of the newly bipedal human female's pelvis and the increasing size of infants' heads precipitated a crisis for the species. ,Natural selection allowed for the adaptation of the human female to this environmental stress by reconfiguring her hormonal cycles, entraining them with the periodicity of the moon. The results, however, did much more than ensure our existence; they imbued women with the concept of time, and gave them control over sex--a power that males sought to reclaim. And the possibility of achieving immortality through heirs drove men to construct patriarchal cultures that went on to dominate so much of human history.,From the nature of courtship to the evolution of language, Shlain's brilliant and wide-ranging exploration stimulates new ways of thinking about very old matters.,"",A masterpiece of ideas and a unique contribution to our understanding of gender and history, sexuality and evolution,."", -- Jean Houston,[,Note: includes Reader's Guide,]","Nonfiction,Science,History,Sexuality,Feminism,Anthropology,Gender,Biology,Evolution,Psychology,Sociology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309206986l/100749.jpg,142004677,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100749.Sex_Time_and_Power,464,"Sex, Time, and Power: How Women's Sexuality Shaped Human Evolution",56

Meghan MacLean Weir,Hardcover,"When Dr. Meghan Weir first dons her scrubs and steps onto the floor of Childrenâ€™s Hospital Boston as a newly minted resident, her head is packed with medical-school-textbook learning. She knows the ins and outs of the human body, has memorized the correct way to perform hundreds of complicated procedures, and can recite the symptoms of any number of diseases by rote. But none of that has truly prepared her for what she is about to experience. ,From the premature infants Dr. Weir is expected to care for on her very first day of residency to the frustrating teenagers who visit the ER at three in the morning for head colds, each day brings with it new challenges and new lessons. Dr. Weir learns that messiness, fear, and uncertainty live beneath the professional exterior of the doctorâ€™s white coat. Yet, in addition to the hardships, the practice of medicine comes with enormous rewards of joy, camaraderie, and the triumph of healing. ,The three years of residencyâ€”when young doctors who have just graduated from medical school take on their own patients for the first timeâ€”are grueling in any specialty. But there is a unique challenge to dealing with patients too young to describe where it hurts, and it is not just having to handle their parents. In Between Expectations: Lessons from a Pediatric Residency, Dr. Weir takes readers into the nurseries, ICUs, and inpatient rooms of one of the countryâ€™s busiest hospitals for children, revealing a world many of us never get to see. With candor and humility, she explores the many humbling lessons that all residents must learn: that restraint is sometimes the right treatment option, no matter how much you want to act; that some patients, even young teenagers, arenâ€™t interested in listening to the good advice that will make their lives easier; that parents ultimately know their own children far better than their doctors ever will. ,Dr. Weirâ€™s thoughtful prose reveals how exhaustion and doubt define the residency experience just as much as confidence and action do. Yet the most important lesson that she learns through the months and years of residency is that having a good day on the floor does not always mean that a patient goes home miraculously healedâ€”more often than not, success is about a steady, gradual discovery of strength. By observing the children, the parents, and other hospital staff who painstakingly provide care each day, Dr. Weir finds herself finally developing into the physician (and the parent) she hopes to become. These storiesâ€”sometimes funny, sometimes hauntingâ€”expose the humanity that is so often obscured by the doctorâ€™s white coat.","Health,Medicine,Medical,Nonfiction,Autobiography,Memoir,Biography,Biography,Autobiography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348966727l/10076317.jpg,1439189072,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10076317-between-expectations,288,Between Expectations: Lessons from a Pediatric Residency,102

Just eight years old when she went into hiding in 1943, Nelly began keeping the diary that would inspire this powerful and moving memoir of her childhood. In her small black journal Nelly wrote about the heartbreaking events she experienced in Lwow and her grief over the tragic losses of family members, as well as the day-to-day fears of life in hiding. In contrast, the exuberant, vividly colored paintings that Nelly also produced while in hiding transformed her grim reality into an enchanting fantasy world filled with school friends, bright skies, and happy families.

"Joel R. Primack,Nancy Ellen Abrams",Hardcover,"A world-renowned astrophysicist and a science philosopher present a new, scientifically supported understanding of the universe, one that will forever change our personal relationship with the cosmos. , For four hundred years, since early scientists discovered that the universe did not revolve around the earth, people have felt cut off-adrift in a meaningless cosmos. That is about to change. , In their groundbreaking new book, ,The View from the Center of the Universe,, Joel R. Primack, Ph.D., one of the world's leading cosmologists, and Nancy Ellen Abrams, a philosopher and writer, use recent advances in astronomy,physics, and cosmology to frame a compelling new theory of how to understand the universe and our role in it. , While most of us think of the universe as empty space peppered with stars separated by vast distances, the truth, the authors argue, is far richer and more meaningful. For the first time in history, we know that the universe is more coherent and spiritually significant than anyone ever imagined and that our place in it is actually central to the expanding universe in important ways. , According to Primack and Abrams, this new cosmology clarifies how the universe operates, what it's made of, how it may have originated, and how it is evolving. Even more surprising, these startling ideas spring from both cutting-edge science and the metaphors of ancient symbols. The result is a very human book that satisfies our fundamental need for order and meaning in our world and in our lives.","Science,Nonfiction,Philosophy,History,Science,Astronomy,Philosophy,Metaphysics,Science,Physics,Science Nature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442005387l/1000077._SY475_.jpg,1594489149,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000077.The_View_from_the_Center_of_the_Universe,400,The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos,90
Anthony Clayton,Paperback,"This suvery draws together into a single integrated account the two major wars of decolonization fought by France in Indochina (in the early 1950's) and Algeria (in the late 1950's), as well as the smaller but far from insignificant military operations that the French conducted in Madagascar, Tunisia and Morocco.,Fought at different times and in very different theatres, these conflicts - little explored in English-language scholarship as yet - have tended to be seen in isolation. By bringing them together within the covers of a single succinct analytical survey, and treating them as different manifestations of the same historical process, a major gap is filled in the literature about modern France, decolonization, and postwar military history alike.,The military operations are set in their widest context. Among the themes explored in detail are: ,- the traditional French attitudes to empire, and how these changed under the pressure of events;,- the French Army's counter-revolutionairy warfare school in the 1950's, and its politically dangerous doctrines;,- the collapse of the Fourth Republic and the return to power of de Gaulle;,- the final drama of withdrawal from Algeria, with its 'ethnic cleaning' of the European settler population.,A model of clear exposition, the study offers fascinating opportunities for comparison with the more familiar decolonization process in the British Empire (on the military aspects of which a volume will be published in the series in due course).

David    Miller,Paperback,"This, Very Short Introduction ,introduces readers to the key concepts of political philosophy: authority, democracy, freedom and its limits, justice, feminism, multiculturalism, and nationality. Accessibly written and assuming no previous knowledge of the subject, it encourages the reader to think clearly and critically about the leading political questions of our time.,Miller first investigates how political philosophy tackles basic ethical questions such as 'how should we live together in society?' He furthermore looks at political authority, discusses the reasons society needs politics in the first place, explores the limitations of politics, and asks if there are areas of life that shouldn't be governed by politics. Moreover, he explores the connections between political authority and justice, a constant theme in political philosophy, and the ways in which social justice can be used to regulate rather than destroy a market economy.,In his travels through this realm, Miller covers why nations are the natural units of government and wonders if the rise of multiculturalism and transnational co-operation will change all this, and asks in the end if we will ever see the formation of a world government.,About the Series: ,Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, ,Very Short Introductions, offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Kathryn Lasky,Hardcover,"The minute she had opened the trunk, she knew there wasn't anything like hope in it. Just awful musty things, but each one with a kind of terrible dark halo around it. She picked up that piece of old lace. She saw that stain -- pale, brownish in color. She knew it was blood. Somebody's blood. There was violence in that trunk, and dark secrets, and she did not want to know them. Curious about the old homestead where she now lives, Jerry finds an ancient trunk in the basement that contains, among other things, an old piece of bloodstained lace, some letters, and a battered doll. The objects in the trunk have stories to tell -- stories about the Spanish Inquisition spanning nearly five hundred years and stories of secrets locked deep in the bloodlines of Jerry's ancestors.,Kathryn Lasky's powerhouse novel is a dramatic historical saga that brings the reader face-to-face with some of the worst atrocities ever committed against humankind in the name of God.

Jenny Edkins,Hardcover,"An analytical look at the ways we define and respond to famine. ,We see famine and look for the likely causes: poor food distribution, unstable regimes, caprices of weather. A technical problem, we tell ourselves, one that modern social and natural science will someday resolve. To the contrary, Jenny Edkins responds in this book: Famine in the contemporary world is not the antithesis of modernity but its symptom. A critical investigation of hunger, famine, and aid practices in international politics, Whose Hunger? shows how the forms and ideas of modernity frame our understanding of famine-and, consequently, shape our responses. ,Edkins examines Malthus and the origins of famine theory in notions of scarcity. Drawing on the work of Lacan, de Waal, Foucault, Zizek, and particularly Derrida, she considers Amartya Sen's entitlement approach, the Band Aid/Live Aid events, and food for work projects in Eritrea as examples of the technologization and repoliticization of famine.

George H. Nash,Hardcover,"National Review has called a ""magisterial work of scholarship on one of our least-known presidents, and an important era in American history.""The entry of the United States into the First World War in late 1911 found Herbert Hoover at a crossroads. Three years earlier, he had been a successful mining engineer in London. Then, as the war intensified in Europe, Hoover founded and led the Commission for Relief in Belgium, which provided desperately needed fuel to more than nine million Belgian and French citizens trapped between the German army of occupation and the British naval blockade. That emergency undertaking eventually evolved into one of the greatest humanitarian enterprises in history. It also brought Hoover into international prominence.Here Herbert Hoover moves toward Washington and center stage in his own country. Shortly after the United States's declaration of war, he entered into able service under Woodrow Wilson as a member of the President's War Cabinet and U.S. Food Administration. His goal was to standardize food production to control surging food prices, and to create surpluses of exportable foodstuffs for America's allies. ""Food will win the war"" became Hoover's slogan.Hoover encountered the tumult of district politics and became both agent and catalyst of the moment in American lives when a traditionally decentralized economy was coming under price control and other forms of governmental restraint. We see Hoover as builder and bureaucrat, a man who brought force, drive, and ability into the service of his country.","Politics,Presidents,History,Biography,Biography Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348838567l/1000249.jpg,393038416,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000249.The_Life_of_Herbert_Hoover_Volume_3,672,"The Life of Herbert Hoover, Volume 3: Master of Emergencies, 1917-1918",72

Maxwell Irvine,Paperback,"With the world desperate to find energy sources that do not emit carbon gases--a desire compounded by the sky-rocketing cost of fossil fuels--nuclear power is back on the agenda and in the news. Yet nuclear power sparks anxiety in many people who are unclear about the nature and extent of the associated risks. In this Very Short Introduction, Maxwell Irvine provides an informative and balanced overview of the entire subject. He presents a concise history of the development of nuclear physics leading up to the emergence of the nuclear power industry and discusses the nature of nuclear energy and the various aspects of public concern, including the risks of nuclear safety, the cost of its development, and the problems of waste disposal. The book looks specifically at safety records, including accounts of the Windscale fire, the Three Mile Island incident, and the Chernobyl disaster. As he dispels much of the widespread confusion about nuclear energy, Irvine argues for the relevance of nuclear power to the ongoing energy crisis and encourages informed debate about its potential.","Science,Science,Physics,Nonfiction,Science,Engineering,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348275555l/10002554.jpg,199584974,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10002554-nuclear-power,144,Nuclear Power: A Very Short Introduction,62

"Bruce Rosenblum,Fred Kuttner",Hardcover,"The most successful theory in all of science--and the basis of one third of our economy--says the strangest things about the world and about us. Can you believe that physical reality is created by our observation of it? Physicists were forced to this conclusion, the quantum enigma, by what they observed in their laboratories.,Trying to understand the atom, physicists built quantum mechanics and found, to their embarrassment, that their theory intimately connects consciousness with the physical world. ,Quantum Enigma, explores what that implies and why some founders of the theory became the foremost objectors to it. Schrï¿½dinger showed that it absurdly allowed a cat to be in a superposition simultaneously dead and alive. Einstein derided the theory's spooky interactions. With Bell's Theorem, we now know Schrï¿½dinger's superpositions and Einstein's spooky interactions indeed exist.,Authors Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner explain all of this in non-technical terms with help from some fanciful stories and bits about the theory's developers. They present the quantum mystery honestly, with an emphasis on what is and what is not speculation.,Physics' encounter with consciousness is its skeleton in the closet. Because the authors open the closet and examine the skeleton, theirs is a controversial book. ,Quantum Enigma's, description of the experimental quantum facts, and the quantum theory explaining them, is undisputed. Interpreting what it all means, however, is controversial.,Every interpretation of quantum physics encounters consciousness. Rosenblum and Kuttner therefore turn to exploring consciousness itself--and encounter quantum physics. Free will and anthropic principles become crucial issues, and the connection of consciousness with the cosmos suggested by some leading quantum cosmologists is mind-blowing.,Readers are brought to a boundary where the particular expertise of physicists is no longer a sure guide. They will find, instead, the facts and hints provided by quantum mechanics and the ability to speculate for themselves.","Science,Science,Physics,Nonfiction,Physics,Quantum Mechanics,Philosophy,Spirituality,Psychology,Science,Popular Science,Biology,Neuroscience,Science,Mathematics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348371268l/100027.jpg,019517559X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100027.Quantum_Enigma,211,Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness,91
Samuel A. Floyd Jr.,Hardcover,"When Jimi Hendrix transfixed the crowds of Woodstock with his gripping version of The Star Spangled Banner, he was building on a foundation reaching back, in part, to the revolutionary guitar playing of Howlin' Wolf and the other great Chicago bluesmen, and to the Delta blues tradition before him. But in its unforgettable introduction, followed by his unaccompanied talking guitar passage and inserted calls and responses at key points in the musical narrative, Hendrix's performance of the national anthem also hearkened back to a tradition even older than the blues, a tradition rooted in the rings of dance, drum, and song shared by peoples across Africa.,Bold and original, ,The Power of Black Music, offers a new way of listening to the music of black America, and appreciating its profound contribution to all American music. Striving to break down the barriers that remain between high art and low art, it brilliantly illuminates the centuries-old linkage between the music, myths and rituals of Africa and the continuing evolution and enduring vitality of African-American music. Inspired by the pioneering work of Sterling Stuckey and Henry Louis Gates, Jr., author Samuel A. Floyd, Jr, advocates a new critical approach grounded in the forms and traditions of the music itself. He accompanies readers on a fascinating journey from the African ring, through the ring shout's powerful merging of music and dance in the slave culture, to the funeral parade practices of the early new Orleans jazzmen, the bluesmen in the twenties, the beboppers in the forties, and the free jazz, rock, Motown, and concert hall composers of the sixties and beyond. Floyd dismisses the assumption that Africans brought to the United States as slaves took the music of whites in the New World and transformed it through their own performance practices. Instead, he recognizes European influences, while demonstrating how much black music has continued to share with its African counterparts. Floyd maintains that while African Americans may not have direct knowledge of African traditions and myths, they can intuitively recognize links to an authentic African cultural memory. For example, in speaking of his grandfather Omar, who died a slave as a young man, the jazz clarinetist Sidney Bechet said, Inside him he'd got the memory of all the wrong that's been done to my people. That's what the memory is....When a blues is good, that kind of memory just grows up inside it. ,Grounding his scholarship and meticulous research in his childhood memories of black folk culture and his own experiences as a musician and listener, Floyd maintains that the memory of Omar and all those who came before and after him remains a driving force in the black music of America, a force with the power to enrich cultures the world over.","Music,History,Nonfiction,Music,Jazz",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347716026l/1000287.jpg,195082354,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000287.The_Power_of_Black_Music,336,The Power of Black Music: Interpreting Its History from Africa to the United States,22

Edward P. Crapol,Hardcover,"The first vice president to become president on the death of the incumbent, John Tyler (1790-1862) was derided by critics as His Accidency. Yet he proved to be a bold leader who used the malleable executive system to his advantage. In this biography of the tenth President of the United States, Edward P. Crapol challenges previous depictions of Tyler as a die-hard advocate of states' rights, limited government, and a strict interpretation of the Constitution.,In pursuit of his agenda, Crapol argues, Tyler exploited executive prerogatives and manipulated constitutional requirements in ways that violated his professed allegiance to a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He set precedents that his successors in the White House invoked to create an American empire and expand presidential power.,Crapol also highlights Tyler's enduring faith in America's national destiny and his belief that boundless territorial expansion would preserve the Union as a slaveholding republic. When Tyler, a Virginian, opted for secession and the Confederacy in 1861, he was stigmatized as America's traitor president for having betrayed the republic he once led. As Crapol demonstrates, Tyler's story anticipates the modern imperial presidency in all its power and grandeur, as well as its darker side.","Politics,Presidents,Biography,History,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Presidents,Us Presidents,Politics,Biography Memoir,Literature,American,War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347336979l/1000303.jpg,807830410,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000303.John_Tyler_the_Accidental_President,332,"John Tyler, the Accidental President",111
John Fabian Witt,Paperback,"In the five decades after the Civil War, the United States witnessed a profusion of legal institutions designed to cope with the nation's exceptionally acute industrial accident crisis. Jurists elaborated the common law of torts. Workingmen's organizations founded a widespread system of cooperative insurance. Leading employers instituted welfare-capitalist accident relief funds. And social reformers advocated compulsory insurance such as workmen's compensation.,John Fabian Witt argues that experiments in accident law at the turn of the twentieth century arose out of competing views of the loose network of ideas and institutions that historians call the ideology of free labor. These experiments a century ago shaped twentieth- and twenty-first-century American accident law; they laid the foundations of the American administrative state; and they occasioned a still hotly contested legal transformation from the principles of free labor to the categories of insurance and risk. In this eclectic moment at the beginnings of the modern state, Witt describes American accident law as a contingent set of institutions that might plausibly have developed along a number of historical paths. In turn, he suggests, the making of American accident law is the story of the equally contingent remaking of our accidental republic.","Law,North American Hi...,American History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347757832l/1000304.jpg,674022610,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000304.The_Accidental_Republic,311,"The Accidental Republic: Crippled Workingmen, Destitute Widows, and the Remaking of American Law",89

Robert Penn,Hardcover,"Robert Penn has saddled up nearly every day of his adult life. In his late twenties, he pedaled 25,000 miles around the world. Today he rides to get to work, sometimes for work, to bathe in air and sunshine, to travel, to go shopping, to stay sane, and to skip bath time with his kids. He's no Sunday pedal pusher. So when the time came for a new bike, he decided to pull out all the stops. He would build his dream bike, the bike he would ride for the rest of his life; a customized machine that reflects the joy of cycling.,It's All About the Bike ,follows Penn's journey, but this book is more than the story of his hunt for two-wheel perfection. En route, Penn brilliantly explores the culture, science, and history of the bicycle. From artisanal frame shops in the United Kingdom to California, where he finds the perfect wheels, via Portland, Milan, and points in between, his trek follows the serpentine path of our love affair with cycling. It explains why we ride.,It's All About the Bike, is, like Penn's dream bike, a tale greater than the sum of its parts.

Evgeny Morozov,ebook,"""The revolution will be Twittered!"" declared journalist Andrew Sullivan after protests erupted in Iran in June 2009. Yet for all the talk about the democratizing power of the Internet, regimes in Iran and China are as stable and repressive as ever. In fact, authoritarian governments are effectively using the Internet to suppress free speech, hone their surveillance techniques, disseminate cutting-edge propaganda, and pacify their populations with digital entertainment. Could the recent Western obsession with promoting democracy by digital means backfire?,In this spirited book, journalist and social commentator Evgeny Morozov shows that by falling for the supposedly democratizing nature of the Internet, Western do-gooders may have missed how it also entrenches dictators, threatens dissidents, and makes it harder - not easier - to promote democracy. Buzzwords like ""21st-century statecraft"" sound good in PowerPoint presentations, but the reality is that ""digital diplomacy"" requires just as much oversight and consideration as any other kind of diplomacy.,Marshaling compelling evidence, Morozov shows why we must stop thinking of the Internet and social media as inherently liberating and why ambitious and seemingly noble initiatives like the promotion of ""Internet freedom"" might have disastrous implications for the future of democracy as a whole.","Nonfiction,Science,Technology,Computers,Internet,Politics,Science,Sociology,History,Business,Philosophy,Social Science,Social Media",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1297025324l/10003400.jpg,1586488759,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10003400-the-net-delusion,432,The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom,78

Joyce Dalsheim,Hardcover,"Joyce Dalsheim's ethnographic study takes a ground-breaking approach to one of the most contentious issues in the Middle East: the Israeli settlement project. Based on fieldwork in the settlements of the Gaza Strip and surrounding communities during the year prior to the Israeli withdrawal, ,Unsettling Gaza, poses controversial questions about the settlement of Israeli occupied territories in ways that move beyond the usual categories of politics, religion, and culture. The book critically examines how religiously-motivated settlers think about living with Palestinians, how they express theological uncertainty, and how they imagine the future beyond the confines of territorial nationalism.,This is the first study to place radical, right-wing settlers and their left-wing and secular opposition in the same analytic frame. Dalsheim shows that the intense antagonism between these groups disguises fundamental similarities. Her analysis reveals the social and cultural work achieved through a politics of mutual denunciation. With theoretical implications stretching far beyond the boundaries of Israel/Palestine, ,Unsettling Gaza,'s counter-intuitive findings shed fresh light on politics and identity among Israelis and the troubling conflicts in Israel/Palestine, as well as providing challenges and insight into the broader questions that exist at the interface between religiosity and formations of the secular.","Anthropology,Ethnography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1302131962l/10003675.jpg,019975120X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10003675-unsettling-gaza,219,"Unsettling Gaza: Secular Liberalism, Radical Religion, and the Israeli Settlement Project",116

Not only does ,The Visionary Window, answer ""yes"" to all of these questions, but it skillfully combines the fields of philosophy, cosmology, religion, and psychology to form a new way of thinking about science and spirituality. Stepping beyond the classic work of prominent seventies physicist Fritjof Capra, Goswami details his own pioneering exploration of science and spirit, revealing the complete integration between modern science and spiritual traditions. Using stories and colorful examples from pop culture, Goswami addresses complex issues in language and terminology easily accessible to the lay reader. He provides quantum physics-based theory and new experimental data verifying the metaphysical truth that exists when employed in the context of a new science, science within the primacy of consciousness. With a new holistic worldview, Goswami also discusses the creativity of the body to self heal; the power of spiritual practice and how to choose a meditative path; and the five stages of spiritual growth, culminating in the ability to transcend the physical laws of nature.

Mark Monmonier,Hardcover,"For years Mark Monmonier, ""a prose stylist of no mean ability or charm"" according to the ,Washington Post,, has delighted readers with his insightful understanding of cartography as an art and technology that is both deceptive and revealing. Now he turns his focus to the story of political cartography and the redrawing of congressional districts. His title ,Bushmanders and Bullwinkles, combines ,gerrymander, with the surname of the president who actively tolerated racial gerrymandering and draws attention to the ridiculously shaped congressional districts that evoke the antlers of the moose who shared the cartoon spotlight with Rocky the Flying Squirrel.,Written from the perspective of a cartographer rather than a political scientist, ,Bushmanders and Bullwinkles, examines the political tales maps tell when votes and power are at stake. Monmonier shows how redistricting committees carve out favorable election districts for themselves and their allies; how disgruntled politicians use shape to challenge alleged racial gerrymanders; and how geographic information systems can make reapportionment a controversial process with outrageous products. He also explores controversies over the proper roles of natural boundaries, media maps, census enumeration, and ethnic identity. Raising important questions about Supreme Court decisions in regulating redistricting, Monmonier asks if the focus on form rather than function may be little more than a distraction from larger issues like election reform. ,Characterized by the same wit and clarity as Monmonier's previous books, ,Bushmanders and Bullwinkles, is essential background for understanding what might prove the most contentious political debate of the new decade.","Science,Geography,Geography,Cartography,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348133526l/1000403.jpg,226534243,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000403.Bushmanders_and_Bullwinkles,216,Bushmanders and Bullwinkles: How Politicians Manipulate Electronic Maps and Census Data to Win Elections,112

Marcus Chown,Hardcover,"The two towering achievements of modern physics are quantum theory and Einstein's general theory of relativity. Together, they explain virtually everything about the world we live in. But, almost a century after their advent, most people haven't the slightest clue what either is about. Did you know that there's so much empty space inside matter that the entire human race could be squeezed into the volume of a sugar cube? Or that you grow old more quickly on the top floor of a building than on the ground floor? And did you realize that 1 per cent of the static on a TV tuned between stations is the relic of the Big Bang? These and many other remarkable facts about the world are direct consequences of quantum physics and relativity. Quantum theory has literally made the modern world possible. Not only has it given us lasers, computers, and nuclear reactors, but it has provided an explanation of why the sun shines and why the ground beneath our feet is solid. Despite this, however, quantum theory and relativity remain a patchwork of fragmented ideas, vaguely understood at best and often utterly mysterious. average person. Author Marcus Chown emphatically disagrees. As Einstein himself said, Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone. If you think that the marvels of modern physics have passed you by, it is not too late. In Chown's capable hands, quantum physics and relativity are not only painless but downright fun. So sit back, relax, and get comfortable as an adept and experienced science communicator brings you quickly up to speed on some of the greatest ideas in the history of human thought.","Science,Science,Physics,Nonfiction,Science,Popular Science,Reference",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348477512l/100044.jpg,309096227,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100044.The_Quantum_Zoo,200,The Quantum Zoo: A Tourist's Guide to the Neverending Universe,27

Jane Hirshfield,Hardcover,"A revelatory, indispensable collection of poems from Jane Hirshfield that centers on beauty, time, and the full embrace of an existence that time cannot help but steal from our arms. ,Hirshfield is unsurpassed in her ability to sink into a momentâ€™s essence and exchange something of herself with its finite musicâ€”and then, in seemingly simple, inevitable words, to deliver that exchange to us in poems that vibrate with form and expression perfectly united. Hirshfieldâ€™s poems of discovery, acknowledgment of the difficult, and praise turn always toward deepening comprehension. Here we encounter the stealth of feelingâ€™s arrival (â€œas some strings, untouched, / sound when a near one is speaking. / So it was when love slipped inside usâ€), an anatomy of solitude (â€œwrong solitude vinegars the soul, / right solitude oils itâ€), a reflection on perishability and the sweetness its acceptance invites into our midst (â€œHow suddenly then / the strange happiness took me, / like a man with strong hands and strong mouthâ€), and a muscular, unblindfolded awareness of our shared political and planetary fate. ,To read these startlingly true poems is to find our own feelings eloquently ensnared. Whether delving into intimately familiar moments or bringing forward some experience until now outside words, Hirshfield finds for each face of our lives its metamorphosing portrait, its particular, memorable, singing and singular name. ,Love in August,White moths,against the screen,in August darkness.,Some clamor ,in envy.,Some spread large,as two hands,of a thief,who wants to put ,back in your cupboard,the long-taken silver.","Poetry,Literature,Nonfiction,Contemporary",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347585325l/10005166.jpg,307595420,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10005166-come-thief,112,"Come, Thief",147

"Henri Frankfort,Samuel Noah Kramer",Paperback,"This classic study clearly establishes a fundamental difference in viewpoint between the peoples of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. By examining the forms of kingship which evolved in the two countries, Frankfort discovered that beneath resemblances fostered by similar cultural growth and geographical location lay differences based partly upon the natural conditions under which each society developed. The river flood which annually renewed life in the Nile Valley gave Egyptians a cheerful confidence in the permanence of established things and faith in life after death. Their Mesopotamian contemporaries, however, viewed anxiously the harsh, hostile workings of nature. ,Frank's superb work, first published in 1948 and now supplemented with a preface by Samuel Noah Kramer, demonstrates how the Egyptian and Mesopotamian attitudes toward nature related to their concept of kingship. In both countries the people regarded the king as their mediator with the gods, but in Mesopotamia the king was only the foremost citizen, while in Egypt the ruler was a divine descendant of the gods and the earthly representative of the God Horus.

Albert Einstein,Paperback,"In 1905, a German technical journal, ,Annalen der Physik, ,published a remarkable paper by a young clerk in the patent office at Berne, Switzerland. The clerk was Albert Einstein. The paper outlined his Special Theory of Relativity, a revolutionary physical theory which discarded the concept of absolute motion in favor of relative motion in the context of a four-dimensional continuum of space-time. It proved to be the most profound revolution in physics since Newton.,About ten years later, building on his earlier work, Einstein formulated the General Theory of Relativity in which he offered a new solution to the great problem of gravitation, postulating the non-Euclidean character of the space-time continuum. Together, the two theories constituted a radically reoriented way of looking at the physical universe, an approach that solved many of the unresolved difficulties of classical mechanics and paved the way for great advances in 20th-century physics. ,This concise volume contains two addresses by Dr. Einstein outlining aspects of the theories. ,Ether and Relativity, (1920), delivered at the University of Leyden, discusses the properties demanded of the ether of space by the theory of relativity. ,Geometry and Experience ,(1921), given at the Prussian Academy of Sciences, describes the limits within which the Euclidean or any other practical geometric system can be held to be approximately true in connection with the concept of a finite universe.,Both lectures are reprinted here complete and unabridged; both express elegant ideas in simple prose devoid of complicated equations or abstruse terminology; both offer scientists and laypeople unparalleled insight into the seminal thinking of the 20th century's greatest physicist. ,

"Rudolf Steiner,N. Macbeth",Paperback,"12 Lectures, Leipzig, September 2-14, 1908 (CW 106),Rudolf Steiner emphasizes the astonishing and special relationship between our own time and that of ancient Egypt--how, in the natural rhythm of the ages, the so-called third post-Atlantian (Egyptian) epoch is mirrored by the fifth (present) epoch. In this sense, today it is especially relevant to look at ancient Egypt with fresh eyes. The evolution of Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by Egyptian myths through the Greek mysteries. Because of other influences, however, this heritage has degenerated; thinking has mummified and and myth has all but disappeared. Consequently, it is important to revive the seed of goodness passed down to us from ancient Egypt.,Through true imagination, it is our task to renew human knowledge related to the creative forces in nature, which the Egyptians attempted through the Osiris-Isis myth, and the Greeks through the myth of Demeter. This is what Rudolf Steiner attempts in this lecture cycle.,Steiner's subjects include: experiences of Egyptian initiations; esoteric anatomy and physiology; the stages of evolution of the human form; and much more. The final lecture is on the Christ impulse as the conqueror of matter.,This volume is a translation from German of ï¿½,ï¿½gyptische Mythen und Mysterien im Verhï¿½ltnis zu den wirkenden Geisteskrï¿½ften der Gegenwart,ï¿½ (GA 106).,C O N T E N T S,Lecture 1.

Paolo Mancosu,Hardcover,"Paolo Mancosu presents a series of innovative studies in the history and the philosophy of logic and mathematics in the first half of the twentieth century. ,The Adventure of Reason ,is divided into five main sections: history of logic (from Russell to Tarski); foundational issues (Hilbert's program, constructivity, Wittgenstein, Godel); mathematics and phenomenology (Weyl, Becker, Mahnke); nominalism (Quine, Tarski); semantics (Tarski, Carnap, Neurath). Mancosu exploits extensive untapped archival sources to make available a wealth of new material that deepens in significant ways our understanding of these fascinating areas of modern intellectual history. At the same time, the book is a contribution to recent philosophical debates, in particular on the prospects for a successful nominalist reconstruction of mathematics, the nature of finitist intuition, the viability of alternative definitions of logical consequence, and the extent to which phenomenology can hope to account for the exact sciences.","Philosophy,Logic,Science,Mathematics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348549487l/10009603.jpg,199546533,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10009603-the-adventure-of-reason,618,"The Adventure of Reason: Interplay Between Philosophy of Mathematics and Mathematical Logic, 1900-1940",118

Stephen Toulmin,Paperback,"In the seventeenth century, a vision arose which was to captivate the Western imagination for the next three hundred years: the vision of Cosmopolis, a society as rationally ordered as the Newtonian view of nature. While fueling extraordinary advances in all fields of human endeavor, this vision perpetuated a hidden yet persistent agenda: the delusion that human nature and society could be fitted into precise and manageable rational categories. Stephen Toulmin confronts that agendaâ€”its illusions and its consequences for our present and future world.,""By showing how different the last three centuries would have been if Montaigne, rather than Descartes, had been taken as a starting point, Toulmin helps destroy the illusion that the Cartesian quest for certainty is intrinsic to the nature of science or philosophy.""â€”Richard M. Rorty, University of Virginia,""[Toulmin] has now tackled perhaps his most ambitious theme of all. . . . His aim is nothing less than to lay before us an account of both the origins and the prospects of our distinctively modern world.

"Rosalind Gill,Christina Scharff",Hardcover,"ThisÂ volume brings together twenty original essays on the changes and continuities in gender relations and intersecting politics of sexuality, race, class and location. The book is located in debates about contemporary culture at a moment of rapid technological change, global interconnectedness and the growing cultural dominance of neoliberalism and postfeminism. The collection traverses disciplines, spaces and approaches. It is marked by an extraordinarily wide focus, ranging from analyses of celebrity magazines and makeover shows to examinations of the experiences of young female migrants, 'mail order brides' and young women who repudiate feminism. The contributions are united by their attempts to think through the ways in which experiences and representations of femininity are changing in the twenty-first century. Are we seeing new femininities? Are neoliberalism and postfeminism constructing new identities and subjectivities? What kinds of analytic tools and cultural politics are needed to critically engage with the current moment?

Ladislas Farago,Paperback,"â€œRich in humor, confidence men, and charm.""â€”,
  ,New York Times,
, Known for his best-selling military histories, Ladislas Farago also wrote a witty tribute to his homeland, ,Strictly from Hungary,. Noting that Hungary has produced some of the world's most renowned artists, scientists, and financiers as well as its share of world-class con-artists, charlatans, and rakes, Farago sets out to explain just how one tiny country can be responsible for so much talent, both good and bad. Using stories from his days as a struggling writer in the bustling cafÃ© scenes of Budapest and New York City, Farago demonstrates the Hungarian knack for remaining irrepressible and optimistic even in the face of catastrophe. Here we meet Zoltan, a fellow Bohemian who presents his astonished benefactor with a play ""about nothing,"" a theme later made famous by another writer of Hungarian descent, Jerry Seinfeld. Farago also introduces us to ""Baby Kiss,"" a vivacious Hungarian beauty queen, and the story of how she ended up in Fort Worth, Texas; Orkeny, a double agent for America at the height of the Cold War who ""spiced up"" his reports to keep everyone happy, and the author's own experience getting mustered into the supposedly non-existent Royal Hungarian Army. Farago's reminiscence validates what most Hungarians believe: that Hungary is the center of the world and that everyone has some connection to the land of the Magyars. In that spirit, Farago learns that George Washington himself was ""strictly from Hungary."" This edition is introduced by the author's son, who shows that the same vibrant spirit described by his father remains the hallmark of the Hungarian temperament.","Cultural,Hungary",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180186282l/1007712._SY475_.jpg,1594160066,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007712.Strictly_from_Hungary,216,Strictly from Hungary,99

Michael S. Sanders,Paperback,"From Here,You Can't See Paris, is a sweet, leisurely exploration of the life of Les Arques (population 159), a hilltop village in a remote corner of France, untouched by the modern era. It is a story of a dying village's struggle to survive, of a dead artist whose legacy began its rebirth, and of chef Jacques Ratier and his wife, NoÃ«lle, whose bustling restaurantâ€”the village's sole businessâ€”has helped ensure its future. ,The author set out to explore the inner workings of a French restaurant kitchen but ended up stumbling onto a wider, much richer world. Whether uncovering the darker secrets of making foie gras, hearing a chef confess his doubts about the Michelin star system, or absorbing the lore of the land around a farmhouse kitchen table after a boar hunt, Michael Sanders learned that life in Les Arques was anything but sleepy. Through the eyes of the author and his family, the reader enters this world, discovers its still-vibrant traditions of food, cooking, and rural living, and comes to know the village's history, sharing along the way an American family's adventures as they find their way in a place that is sometimes lonely, often wondrous, and always fascinating.","Travel,Cultural,France,Nonfiction,Food and Drink,Food,Autobiography,Memoir,Food and Drink,Food Writing,Food and Drink,Culinary,Food and Drink,Cooking,Cultural,Food and Drink,Foodie",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348985125l/1007810.jpg,60959207,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007810.From_Here_You_Can_t_See_Paris,352,"From Here, You Can't See Paris: Seasons of a French Village and Its Restaurant",44

Patricia Fara,Hardcover,"An Entertainment for Angels, rather than for Men, one observer called electricity, and it proved to be the most significant scientific discovery of the Enlightenment. Lecturers attracted huge audiences who marveled at sparkling fountains, flaming drinks, pirouetting dancers, and electrified boys. Flamboyant experimenters made chains of soldiers leap into the air, while wealthy women titillated their admirers with a sensational electric kiss. Optimists predicted that this strange power of nature would cure illnesses, improve crop production, even bring the dead back to life. ,An Entertainment for Angels, tells the story of how electricity charged the eighteenth-century imagination. With contemporary illustrations and engaging prose, Patricia Fara vividly portrays the struggles to understand the unusual and exciting effects that electrical experiments were producing.,One of the heroes of the story is Benjamin Franklin, renowned on both sides of the Atlantic as an expert on electricity, who introduced lightning rods to protect tall buildings, pioneered techniques to treat paralyzed patients, and developed one of the most successful explanations of this mysterious phenomenon. Others include Luigi Galvani, whose electrical research on frogs and animals makes for grisly reading but led to the discovery of direct current electricity; and Alessandro Volta, who--with Napoleon's enthusiastic support--became one of Europe's leading scientific practitioners and invented the world's first battery.","Nonfiction,Science,History Of Science,Science,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347563624l/1007860.jpg,231131488,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007860.An_Entertainment_for_Angels,192,An Entertainment for Angels: Electricity in the Enlightenment,56

James Naremore,Paperback,"""Film noir"" evokes memories of stylish, cynical, black-&-white movies from the 40s & 50s--melodramas about private eyes, femmes fatales, criminal gangs & lovers on the run. ,More Than Night, discusses such pictures. It also shows that the central term is more complex & paradoxical than realized. Film noir refers both to an important cinematic legacy & to an idea projected onto the past. This wide-ranging cultural history offers an original approach to the subject, as well as new production information & commentary on scores of films, including ,Double Indemnity,, ,The Third Man,, & ,Out of the Past,, & such neo-noirs as ,Chinatown,, ,Pulp Fiction, & ,Devil in a Blue Dress,. Naremore discusses film noir as a term in criticism; as an expression of artistic modernism; as a symptom of Hollywood censorship & politics in the 40s; as a market strategy; as an evolving style; as a cinema about race & nationality & as an idea that circulates across all information technologies. This interdisciplinary book has valuable things to say not only about film & tv, but also about modern literature, the fine arts & popular culture in general. In a field where much of what's published is superficial & derivative, this work is certain to be received as a definitive treatment.","Culture,Film,Nonfiction,Mystery,Noir,Media Tie In,History,Textbooks,Academic,School",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387665170l/1007865.jpg,520212940,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007865.More_than_Night,359,More than Night: Film Noir in its Contexts,149
Karen Hesse,Paperback,"Nyle's life with her grandmother on their Vermont sheep farm advances rhythmically through the seasons until the night of the accident at the Cookshire nuclear power plant. Without warning, Nyle's modest world fills with protective masks, evacuations, contaminated food, disruptions, and mistrust.,Nyle adjusts to the changes. As long as the fallout continues blowing to the East, Nyle, Gran, and the farm can go on. But into this uncertain haven stumble Ezra Trent and his mother, ""refugees"" from the heart of the accident, who take temporary shelter in the back bedroom of Nyle's house.,The back bedroom is the dying room: It took her mother when Nyle was six; it stole away her grandfather just two years ago. Now Ezra is back there and Nyle doesn't want to open her heart to him. Too many times she's let people in, only to have them desert her.,Karen Hesse's voice and vision are grounded in truth; she takes on a nearly unharnessable subject, contains it, and makes it resonate with honesty.

"Hermann Hesse,James Wright",Hardcover,"On May 2, 1919, Hesse wrote to Romain Rolland: ""I have had to bear a very heavy burden in my personal life in recent years. Now I am about to go to Ticino once again, to live for a while as a hermit in nature and in my work."" In 1920, after settling in the Ticino mountain village of Montagnola, he published Wandering, a love letter to this magic-garden world that can be read as a meditation on his attempt to begin a new life. His pure prose, his heartfelt lyricism, and his love for the old earth, for its blessings that renew themselves, all sing in this serene book. ,The first German edition of Wandering included facsimiles of fourteen watercolor landscapes. Hesse's painting had blossomed in the southern countryside and he even toyed with the idea ""that I might still succeed in escaping literature entirely and making a living at the more appealing trade of painter.""

Pier Vittorio Aureli,Paperback,"Architectural form reconsidered in light of a unitary conception of architecture and the city.,In ,The Possibility of an Absolute Architecture,, Pier Vittorio Aureli proposes that a sharpened formal consciousness in architecture is a precondition for political, cultural, and social engagement with the city. Aureli uses the term absolute not in the conventional sense of ""pure,"" but to denote something that is resolutely itself after being separated from its other. In the pursuit of the possibility of an absolute architecture, the other is the space of the city, its extensive organization, and its government. Politics is agonism through separation and confrontation; the very condition of architectural form is to separate and be separated. Through its act of separation and being separated, architecture reveals at once the essence of the city and the essence of itself as political form: the city as the composition of (separate) parts. Aureli revisits the work of four architects whose projects were advanced through the making of architectural form but whose concern was the city at large: Andrea Palladio, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Etienne Louis-Boull'e, and Oswald Mathias Ungers. The work of these architects, Aureli argues, addressed the transformations of the modern city and its urban implications through the elaboration of specific and strategic architectural forms. Their projects for the city do not take the form of an overall plan but are expressed as an ""archipelago"" of site-specific interventions.","Architecture,Philosophy,Theory,Nonfiction,Cities,Urbanism,European Literature,Italian Literature,Art,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348406988l/10079601.jpg,262515792,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10079601-the-possibility-of-an-absolute-architecture,251,The Possibility of an Absolute Architecture,144

In a carefully arranged sequence of 23 lessons, Lewis V. Thomas, late Professor of Oriental Studies at Princeton, presents thorough coverage that allows the student to begin to use the basic patterns of modern Turkish without time-consuming and expensive private instruction.,The method of instruction was devised after an extensive analysis of results in Princeton classrooms, and relies on exercises at the end of each lesson to test the student's grasp of the material. Beginning with the alphabet and numbers, Professor Thomas offers clear, concise coverage of articles, adjectives and nouns, common infinitives, personal pronouns, and elementary verbs. As the student's comprehension of basic elements develops, further lessons deal with more complicated subjects such as the possessive construction, past general verbs, postpositions, the partitive, progressive verb forms, and abbreviating verb forms. A complete Turkish-English glossary translates new vocabulary occurring in the exercises.,Norman Itzkowitz, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, has skillfully made the necessary revisions and additions to complete Professor Thomas' work.

The authors discuss the influence of personal and cultural values on which questions are asked, how they are asked, and how they are addressed in the opening chapter and use this perspective in discussions of specific methods throughout the book. This focus on the importance of conscience and conviction in research on social behavior is a unique and enduring feature of this new Seventh Edition. Ideal for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, this Seventh Edition covers all the major research methods used by social scientists, with special attention devoted to methods that are well-suited to the study of real world social problems. Most of the examples drawn from the published literature or developed specifically for the book concern a social problem for which social science research is relevant. Your students will see how social science research can be used to address questions such as: To what factors can the escalation of violence in schools be attributed? Why, in the midst of an AIDS epidemic to people engage in risky sexual behavior? Can ethnic prejudice be reduced?

Her book features an encyclopedia of favorite quilt styles, detailing the stories behind applique quilts, crazy quilts, art quilts, scrap quilts, sampler quilts, and whole-cloth quilts, as well as traditional patchwork patterns like the Nine Patch, Log Cabin, and Double Wedding Ring. ,The Quilt, is gloriously illustrated with more than 200 full-color photographs of classic collectible quilts, close-up detail shots, current and historical photos of quilters, and vintage quilting memorabilia such as pattern booklets, advertisements, posters, postcards, and more.","Crafts,Quilting,Nonfiction,Crafts,Sewing",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328817940l/1008034.jpg,760326886,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1008034.The_Quilt,348,The Quilt: A History and Celebration of an American Art Form,90

Amy Erdman Farrell,Hardcover,"One of Choice's Significant University Press Titles for Undergraduates, 2010-2011,To be fat hasn't always occasioned the level of hysteria that this condition receives today and indeed was once considered an admirable trait. ,Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture, explores this arc, from veneration to shame, examining the historic roots of our contemporary anxiety about fatness. Tracing the cultural denigration of fatness to the mid 19th century, Amy Farrell argues that the stigma associated with a fat body preceded any health concerns about a large body size. Firmly in place by the time the diet industry began to flourish in the 1920s, the development of fat stigma was related not only to cultural anxieties that emerged during the modern period related to consumer excess, but, even more profoundly, to prevailing ideas about race, civilization and evolution. For 19th and early 20th century thinkers, fatness was a key marker of inferiority, of an uncivilized, barbaric, and primitive body. This idea--that fatness is a sign of a primitive person--endures today, fueling both our $60 billion -war on fat- and our cultural distress over the -obesity epidemic.- Farrell draws on a wide array of sources, including political cartoons, popular literature, postcards, advertisements, and physicians' manuals, to explore the link between our historic denigration of fatness and our contemporary concern over obesity. Her work sheds particular light on feminisms' fraught relationship to fatness. From the white suffragists of the early 20th century to contemporary public figures like Oprah Winfrey, Monica Lewinsky, and even the Obama family, Farrell explores the ways that those who seek to shed stigmatized identities--whether of gender, race, ethnicity or class--often take part in weight reduction schemes and fat mockery in order to validate themselves as -civilized.- In sharp contrast to these narratives of fat shame are the ideas of contemporary fat activists, whose articulation of a new vision of the body Farrell explores in depth. This book is significant for anyone concerned about the contemporary -war on fat- and the ways that notions of the -civilized body- continue to legitimate discrimination and cultural oppression.","Nonfiction,Feminism,Fat,Fat Studies,Sociology,History,Health,Fat,Health,Politics,Fat,Fat Acceptance,Social Movements,Social Justice",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417982238l/10080729.jpg,814727689,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10080729-fat-shame,219,Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture,59

Alison Weir,Paperback,"On the night of 10 February 1567 an explosion devastated the Edinburgh residence of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. The noise was heard as far away as Holyrood Palace, where Queen Mary was attending a wedding masque. Those arriving at the scene of devastation found, in the garden, the naked corpses of Darnley and his valet. Neither had died in the explosion, but both bodies bore marks of strangulation.,It was clear that they had been murdered and the house destroyed in an attempt to obliterate the evidence. Darnley was not a popular king-consort, but he was regarded by many as having a valid claim to the English throne. For this reason Elizabeth I had opposed his family's longstanding wish to marry him to Mary Stuart, who herself claimed to be the rightful queen of England.,Alison Weir's investigation of Darnley's murder is set against one of the most dramatic periods in British history. Her conclusions shed a brilliant new light on the actions and motives of the conspirators and, in particular, the extent of Mary's own involvement.","History,Nonfiction,Biography,Historical,Cultural,Scotland,English History,Tudor Period,European Literature,British Literature,Crime,True Crime,Literature,16th Century,History,European History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1166113920l/10080.jpg,712664564,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10080.Mary_Queen_of_Scots_and_the_Murder_of_Lord_Darnley,640,Mary Queen of Scots and the Murder of Lord Darnley,111

James Lee Burke,Hardcover,"Sheriff Hackberry Holland patrols a small Southwest Texas border town with a deep and abiding respect for the citizens in his care. Still mourning the loss of his cherished wife and locked in a perilous almost-romance with his deputy, Pam Tibbs, a woman many decades his junior, Hackberry feeds off the deeds of evil men to keep his own demons at bay. When alcoholic ex-boxer Danny Boy Lorca witnesses a man tortured to death in the desert and reports it, Hack's investigation leads to the home of Anton Ling, a regal, mysterious Chinese woman whom the locals refer to as La Magdalena and who is known for sheltering illegals. Ling denies having seen the victim or the perpetrators, but there is something in her steely demeanor and aristocratic beauty that compels Hackberry to return to her home again and again as the investigation unfolds. Could it be that the sheriff is so taken in by this creature who reminds him of his deceased wife that he would ignore the possibility that she is just as dangerous as the men she harbors?,The danger in the desert increases tenfold with the return of serial murderer Preacher Jack Collins, whom ""The New York Times ""called ""one of Burke's most inspired villains."" Presumed dead at the close of ""Rain Gods,"" Preacher Jack has reemerged with a calm, single-minded zeal for killing that is more terrifying than the muzzle flash of his signature machine gun.

Dipesh Chakrabarty,Paperback,"First published in 2000, Dipesh Chakrabarty's influential ,Provincializing Europe, addresses the mythical figure of Europe that is often taken to be the original site of modernity in many histories of capitalist transition in non-Western countries. This imaginary Europe, Dipesh Chakrabarty argues, is built into the social sciences. The very idea of historicizing carries with it some peculiarly European assumptions about disenchanted space, secular time, and sovereignty. Measured against such mythical standards, capitalist transition in the third world has often seemed either incomplete or lacking. ,Provincializing Europe, proposes that every case of transition to capitalism is a case of translation as well--a translation of existing worlds and their thought--categories into the categories and self-understandings of capitalist modernity. Now featuring a new preface in which Chakrabarty responds to his critics, this book globalizes European thought by exploring how it may be renewed both for and from the margins.","History,Nonfiction,Philosophy,Philosophy,Theory,Academic,Politics,Literature,Post Colonial,Anthropology,Sociology,Cultural,India",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515427740l/1008155._SY475_.jpg,691130019,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1008155.Provincializing_Europe,301,Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference - New Edition,19

Grant Morrison,Hardcover,"From one of the most acclaimed and profound writers in the world of comics comes a thrilling and provocative exploration of humankindâ€™s great modern myth: the superhero,Â ,The first superhero comic ever published, ,Action Comics no. 1, in 1938, introduced the world to something both unprecedented and timeless: Superman, a caped god for the modern age. In a matter of years, the skies of the imaginary world were filled with strange mutants, aliens, and vigilantes: Batman, Wonder Woman, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, and the X-Menâ€”the list of names as familiar as our own. In less than a century, theyâ€™ve gone from not existing at all to being everywhere we look: on our movie and television screens, in our videogames and dreams.

In this exhilarating work of a lifetime, Morrison draws on art, science, mythology, and his own astonishing journeys through this shadow universe to provide the first true history of the superheroâ€”why they matter, why they will always be with us, and what they tell us about who we are . . . and what we may yet become.","Nonfiction,Sequential Art,Comics,History,Biography,Comics,Superheroes,Sequential Art,Graphic Novels,Culture,Pop Culture,Autobiography,Memoir,Philosophy,Cultural",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327885368l/10081832.jpg,1400069122,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10081832-supergods,444,"Supergods: What Masked Vigilantes, Miraculous Mutants, and a Sun God from Smallville Can Teach Us About Being Human",17

Christopher  McIntosh,Paperback,"This classic study of the French magician Eliphas Levi and the occult revival in France is at last available again after being out of print and highly sought after for many years. Its central focus is Levi himself (1810-1875), would-be priest, revolutionary socialist, utopian visionary, artist, poet and, above all, author of a number of seminal books on magic and occultism. It is largely thanks to Levi, for example, that the Tarot is so widely used today as a divinatory method and a system of esoteric symbolism. The magicians of the Golden Dawn were strongly influenced by him, and Aleister Crowley even believed himself to be Levi's reincarnation. The book is not only about Levi, however, but also covers the era of which he was a part and the remarkable figures who preceded and followed him - the esoteric Freemasons and Illuminati of the late 18th century, and later figures such as the Rosicrucian magus Josephin Peladan, the occultist Papus (Gerard Encausse), the Counter-Pope Eugene Vintras, and the writer J.-K. Huysmans, whose work drew strongly on occult themes. These people were avatars of a set of traditions which are now seen as an important part of the western heritage and which are gaining increasing attention in the academy. Christopher McIntosh's vivid account of this richly fascinating era in the history of occultism remains as fresh and compelling as ever.","Occult,History,Biography,Cultural,France,Satanism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348367158l/10081851.jpg,1438435568,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10081851-eliphas-l-vi-and-the-french-occult-revival,238,Eliphas LÃ©vi and the French Occult Revival,125

"Alan Brinkley,Sean Wilentz",Hardcover,"The young president who brought vigor and glamour to the White House while he confronted cold war crises abroad and calls for social change at home,John Fitzgerald Kennedy was a new kind of president. He redefined how Americans came to see the nation's chief executive. He was forty-three when he was inaugurated in 1961â€”the youngest man ever elected to the officeâ€”and he personified what he called the ""New Frontier"" as the United States entered the 1960s.,But as Alan Brinkley shows in this incisive and lively assessment, the reality of Kennedy's achievements was much more complex than the legend. His brief presidency encountered significant failuresâ€”among them the Bay of Pigs fiasco, which cast its shadow on nearly every national-security decision that followed. But Kennedy also had successes, among them the Cuban Missile Crisis and his belated but powerful stand against segregation.,Kennedy seemed to live on a knife's edge, moving from one crisis to anotherâ€”Cuba, Laos, Berlin, Vietnam, Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. His controversial public life mirrored his hidden private life. He took risks that would seem reckless and even foolhardy when they emerged from secrecy years later. ,John F. Kennedy's life, and his violent and sudden death, reshaped our view of the presidency.

John Peacock,Paperback,"In the 1960s, ""youth"" was the watchword. Skirts became shorter and shorter until in 1965 they culminated in the mini. The gap between stocking top and skirt hem made tights essential, and the quintessential little-girl look of the sixties was born: neat, uncluttered, flat-chested, and long-legged. By the last years of the decade hems were dropping again and the influence of the hippie movement was beginning to be felt in both women's and men's wear, bringing with it bright colors and psychedelic patterns.,John Peacock's Fashion Sourcebooks are destined to become an indispensable part of the library of any fashion enthusiast, historian, or collector, and are sure to provide inspiration to any designer or student working in the performing arts.","Couture,Fashion,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347336054l/1008256.jpg,500280401,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1008256.Fashion_Sourcebooks,64,Fashion Sourcebooks: The 1960s,74
John Peacock,Hardcover,"Here, in more than 1,000 full-color illustrations, is the unrivaled sourcebook of fashion in the Western world - spanning forty centuries from ancient Egyptian robes to today's latest Parisian designs. ,The Chronicle of Western Fashion, records the astonishing variety of ways in which the human form can be adorned - from the relative simplicity of the classical world, to the elaborate social distinctions implicit in the clothing of the Middle Ages, through the exotic richness of the Renaissance, on to the changing conventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the vibrant diversity of twentieth-century fashion. ,John Peacock's meticulous color drawings are based on a lifetime of extensive research. Organized chronologically, the drawings are accompanied by detailed descriptions of each figure, including the individual items of dress shown and the fabric, cut, pattern, and color that have been used in each instance.

Desire doesn't give a whit about shame.

Tad Williams,Mass Market Paperback,"Otherland. In many ways it is humankind's most stunning achievement: a private, multidimensional universe built over two generations by the greatest minds of the twenty-first century. But this most exclusive of places is also one of the world's best kept secrets, created and controlled by an organization made up of the world's most powerful and ruthless individuals, a private cartel known--to those who know of their existence at all--as The Grail Brotherhood. Though their purpose in creating Otherland is still a mystery, it may not remain so for long. For they have exacted a terrible price from humanity in the process, and even their highly organized global conspiracy cannot hide the nature of their crimes forever. And now a small band of adventurers has penetrated the veil of secrecy that prevents the uninitiated from entering Otherland. But having broken into the amazing worlds within worlds that make up this universe, they are trapped, unable to escape back to their own flesh-and-blood bodies in the real world. And as dangers and circumstances split their party into small, widely scattered groups, their only hope of reuniting lies in returning again and again to the River that flows--in one form or another--through all the worlds.,But the odds seem to be completely against them as they--and the one outsider with whom they might join forces--become hopelessly lost in realms where an Ice Age tribe's fears can only be quenched in blood...where insects are as large and deadly as dinosaurs...where they are caught in the war between a man made of straw and one made of tin...where cartoon ads take on a life of their own...where humans strive to survive in the aftermath of an alien invasion...and where one among their party is actually The Grail Brotherhood's most terrifying weapon--a sociopathic killer who has never failed and whose current mission is to make certain that not even one member of this little invasion force lives long enough to reveal the truth about Otherland to the people of Earth...","Fantasy,Science Fiction,Fiction,Science Fiction,Cyberpunk,Science Fiction Fantasy,Adventure,Fantasy,Epic Fantasy,Speculative Fiction,Epic,Fantasy,Urban Fantasy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309992269l/10084.jpg,886778441,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10084.River_of_Blue_Fire,675,River of Blue Fire,143
Wendy Lesser,Hardcover,"Most previous books about Dmitri Shostakovich have focused on either his symphonies and operas, or his relationship to the regime under which he lived, or both, since these large-scale works were the ones that attracted the interest and sometimes the condemnation of the Soviet authorities. ,Music for Silenced Voices, looks at Shostakovich through the back door, as it were, of his fifteen quartets, the works which his widow characterized as a ""diary, the story of his soul."" The silences and the voices were of many kinds, including the political silencing of adventurous writers, artists, and musicians during the Stalin era; the lost voices of Shostakovich's operas (a form he abandoned just before turning to string quartets); and the death-silenced voices of his close friends, to whom he dedicated many of these chamber works.,Wendy Lesser has constructed a fascinating narrative in which the fifteen quartets, considered one at a time in chronological order, lead the reader through the personal, political, and professional events that shaped Shostakovich's singular, emblematic twentieth-century life. Weaving together interviews with the composer's friends, family, and colleagues, as well as conversations with present-day musicians who have played the quartets, Lesser sheds new light on the man and the musician. One of the very few books about Shostakovich that is aimed at a general rather than an academic audience, ,Music for Silenced Voices, is a pleasure to read; at the same time, it is rigorously faithful to the known facts in this notoriously complicated life. It will fill readers with the desire to hear the quartets, which are among the most compelling and emotionally powerful monuments of the past century's music.","Music,Biography,Nonfiction,History,Music,Classical Music,Cultural,Russia",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328848167l/10085062.jpg,300169337,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10085062-music-for-silenced-voices,368,Music for Silenced Voices: Shostakovich and His Fifteen Quartets,92

From beside me a voice said in Arabic, 'Shall we pray, brother?' A guard came and screamed in my ear, 'Shut up, motherfucker, if you speak again I'll kill you.'""--from ,Enemy Combatant,Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has become a worldwide symbol of the dark side of America's War on Terror. Here, for the first time, is a powerful and moving story from the other side, the first detainee's account of life inside the notorious prison. A highly educated British Muslim, Moazzam Begg spent three years in U.S. custody, nearly two of them in Guantanamo, before being released without charge in January of 2005. ,Enemy Combatant,, written with respected UK journalist Victoria Brittain, is the wrenching narrative of Begg's detention, including his eighteen months in solitary confinement. Secretly abducted at midnight from his home in Afghanistan, held incommunicado in Kandahar and Bagram Air Force base, Begg was eventually flown to Guantanamo, where, like more than 800 Muslim men and boys--550 of whom remain in custody--he was held in shackles and the now-trademark orange prison uniform, subjected to relentless interrogations and abusive and degrading conditions.,A riveting, personal story by a thoughtful and eloquent man, ,Enemy Combatant, is a uniquely personal indictment of America's establishment of a global gulag that flouts the Geneva conventions--one of the great miscarriages ofjustice in our time.","Nonfiction,Politics,Biography,Autobiography,Memoir,History,Religion,Islam,Biography,Autobiography,Biography Memoir,War,The United States Of America",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347523034l/100866.jpg,1595581367,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100866.Enemy_Combatant,397,Enemy Combatant,132
Ben Hewitt,Hardcover,"
  ,
    ,Food recalls have become so ubiquitous we hardly even notice them. The massive peanut salmonella,contamination of 2008â€“2009 alone killed nine and sickened an estimated 22,500 people; only a few,weeks later, contaminated frozen cookie dough sent 35 people to the hospital. These tragic, inexcusable events to which no one is immune are but a symptom of a broader food system malaise.,
    ,Â ,
    ,In ,Making Supper Safe,, Ben Hewitt exposes the vulnerabilities inherent to the US food industry, where the majority of our processing facilities are inspected only once every seven years, and where government agencies lack the necessary resources to act on early warning signs. The most dangerous aspect of our food system isnâ€™t just its potential to make us acutely ill, but the ever expanding distance between us and our sources of nourishment.,
    ,Hewitt introduces a vibrant cast of characters and revolutionaries who are reinventing how we grow,,process, package, distribute, and protect our food, and even how we protect ourselves. He takes readers inside a food contamination trace-back investigation, goes dumpster diving, and talks to lawyers, policy makers, and families who have been affected by contaminated food. ,Making Supper Safe, explains why we should worry, but it is also a quest to understand how we can learn to trust our food again.,

"Margaret Sanger,Margaret Marsh",Paperback,"Margaret Sanger (1883-1966) was a leading figure in the American birth control movement. Trained as a nurse, she moved to New York City to work among the poor. Having witnessed firsthand the travails of mothers in the city's poorest neighborhoods, she felt the need to provide them with information on reproduction and contraception. She abandoned her nursing career and devoted the rest of her life to disseminating information on women's reproduction and contraception, publishing books and articles and founding birth control clinics. In ,Motherhood in Bondage,, first published in 1928, Sanger reproduced letters written to her from women and sometimes men from all over the country, in both urban and rural areas, who were seeking advice on reproductive matters and marital relations, but mostly imploring her to help them find ways to avoid more pregnancies. The letters are grouped by theme into sixteen chapters, and Sanger wrote an introduction to each chapter. In her new foreword for this edition, Margaret Marsh describes the controversies surrounding these letters and places them in their historical context. ,Margaret Marsh, is a professor of history at Rutgers University and Dean of the faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School for the Camden campus.","Feminism,Nonfiction,History,Health,Womens",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180198224l/1008701.jpg,081425036X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1008701.Motherhood_in_Bondage,446,Motherhood in Bondage,64

Linda Garber,Paperback,"""Queer theory,"" asserts Linda Garber, ""alternately buries and vilifies lesbian feminism, missing its valuable insights and ignoring its rich contributions."" Rejecting the either/or choice between lesbianism and queer theory, she favors an inclusive approach that defies current factionalism. In an eloquent challenge to the privileging of queer theory in the academy, Garber calls for recognition of the historical--and intellectually significant--role of lesbian poets as theorists of lesbian identity and activism.,The connections, Garber shows, are most clearly seen when looking at the pivotal work of working-class lesbians/lesbians of color whose articulations of multiple, simultaneous identity positions and activist politics both belong to lesbian feminism and presage queer theory. ,Identity Poetics, includes a critical overview of recent historical writing about the women's and lesbian-feminist movements of the 1970s; discussions of the works of Judy Grahn, Pat Parker, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, and Gloria Anzaldï¿½a; and, finally, a chapter on the rise and hegemony of queer theory within lesbigay studies.","Feminism,Poetry,Nonfiction,GLBT,Queer,History,LGBT,GLBT,Queer Studies,Philosophy,Theory,LGBT,Lesbian",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347321151l/1008787.jpg,231110332,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1008787.Identity_Poetics,304,"Identity Poetics: Race, Class, and the Lesbian-Feminist Roots of Queer Theory",77
"Hubert L. Dreyfus,Sean Dorrance Kelly",ebook,"An unrelenting flow of choices confronts us at nearly every moment of our lives, and yet our culture offers us no clear way to choose. This predicament seems inevitable, but in fact it's quite new. In medieval Europe, God's calling was a grounding force. In ancient Greece, a whole pantheon of shining gods stood ready to draw an appropriate action out of you. Like an athlete in â€œthe zone,â€ you were called to a harmonious attunement with the world, so absorbed in it that you couldnâ€™t make a â€œwrongâ€ choice. If our culture no longer takes for granted a belief in God, can we nevertheless get in touch with the Homeric moods of wonder and gratitude, and be guided by the meanings they reveal?,All Things Shining ,says we can. Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly illuminate some of the greatest works of the West to reveal how we have lost our passionate engagement with and responsiveness to the world. Their journey takes us from the wonder and openness of Homerâ€™s polytheism to the monotheism of Dante; from the autonomy of Kant to the multiple worlds of Melville; and, finally, to the spiritual difficulties evoked by modern authors such as David Foster Wallace and Elizabeth Gilbert.,Dreyfus, a philosopher at the University of California, Berkeley, for forty years, is an original thinker who finds in the classic texts of our culture a new relevance for peopleâ€™s everyday lives. His lively, thought-provoking lectures have earned him a podcast audience that often reaches the iTunesU Top 40. Kelly, chair of the philosophy department at Harvard University, is an eloquent new voice whose sensitivity to the sadness of the cultureâ€” and to what remains of the wonder and gratitude that could chase it awayâ€”captures a generation adrift.,Re-envisioning modern spiritual life through their examination of literature, philosophy, and religious testimony, Dreyfus and Kelly unearth ancient sources of meaning, and teach us how to rediscover the sacred, shining things that surround us every day. This book will change the way we understand our culture, our history, our sacred practices, and ourselves. It offers a newâ€”and very oldâ€”way to celebrate and be grateful for our existence in the modern world.","Philosophy,Nonfiction,Literature,History,Religion,Writing,Books About Books,Classics,Criticism,Literary Criticism,Criticism,Spirituality",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348914837l/10087892.jpg,1439101701,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10087892-all-things-shining,272,All Things Shining: Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age,12

Anne Enright,Paperback,"The second novel to be published in America by widely acclaimed Irish author Anne Enright, The Wig My Father Wore is a spry, hilarious novel about parents, love, religion, and the absurdities of them all. Grace is a young Dubliner who works on a television show called Love Quiz. Her father is going benignly senile, but her life otherwise seems fairly solid. When Stephen arrives on her doorstep, however, Grace has no idea what she's in for. Stephen explains that he is an angel, a former bridge builder who committed suicide in 1934. He has been sent back to earth (as all suicides are) to guide lost souls. Grace does not take this personally at first, but eventually she has to face the idea that things are not so easy, and that her greatest intimacy is with this supernatural creature. As Grace begins to take stock of her life and the prospect of caring enough about something to fight for it, The Wig My Father Wore takes us on a moving, surreal romp through Catholicism, parents, and the reclamation of love from the twin modern evils of cynicism and the detritus of pop culture.","Fiction,European Literature,Irish Literature,Contemporary,Literary Fiction,Novels",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348825175l/100885.jpg,802138322,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100885.The_Wig_My_Father_Wore,224,The Wig My Father Wore,16

Elizabeth Charlotte von der Pfalz,Paperback,"On 16 November 1671, Liselotte von der Pfalz, the nineteen-year-old daughter of the Elector of Palatine, was married to Philippe d'Orleans, ""Monsieur, "" the only brother of Louis XIV. The marriage was not to be a happy one. Liselotte (known in France as Elisabeth Charlotte, Duchesse d'Orleans, or ""Madame"") was full of intellectual energy and moral rigor. Homesick for her native Germany, she felt temperamentally ill-suited to life at the French court. The homosexual Monsieur, deeply immersed in the pleasures and intrigues of the court, shared few of his wife's interests. Yet, for the next fifty years, Liselotte remained in France, never far from the center of one of the most glorious courts of Europe. And throughout this period, she wrote letters - sometimes as many as forty a week - to her friends and relatives in Germany. It is from this extraordinary body of correspondence that A Woman's Life in the Court of the Sun King has been fashioned. As introduced and translated by Elborg Forster, the letters have become the remarkable personal narrative of Liselotte's transformation from an innocent, yet outspoken, girl into a formidable observer of great events and human folly.","History,Nonfiction,Cultural,France,Biography,Historical,Literature,18th Century,Literature,17th Century",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1223632712l/1008965.jpg,801856353,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1008965.A_Woman_s_Life_in_the_Court_of_the_Sun_King,352,"A Woman's Life in the Court of the Sun King: Letters of Liselotte Von Der Pfalz, Elisabeth Charlotte, Duchesse D' OrlÃ©ans, 1652-1722",100

"Lars Anderson,Chad Millman",Paperback,"The history of blacktop basketball in fast-paced words and pictures. A New York street hustler. A lonely man in a Maryland prison. A confused Native American on a reservation in Idaho. What do they all have in common? They are among the best pickup basketball players in the country. In Pickup Artists, Lars Anderson and Chad Millman tell the complete story of the street game from its mythical past to its glorious present. Using original reporting to examine the evolution of playground basketball, Anderson and Millman are the first journalists to unravel the thickly woven tapestry of the sportâ€™s subculture. Todayâ€™s super-hyped, corporate-sponsored tournaments werenâ€™t always the norm. The foundation of the game was laid with sweat in the 1920s and it has grown from a rudimentary sport to a sophisticated exhibition. Basketball is more than macho melodramas acted out in Americaâ€™s inner cities. Itâ€™s a town meeting in the heart of Indiana and symbol of freedom for prisoners in jail. Anderson and Millman tap into the essence of pickup basketball, examining its importance everywhere the game is played. They profile not just legends like Earl Marigault and Joe Hammond, but players like Fred â€œSpookâ€ Stegman, the man who carries the legacy of being the first to connect the playgrounds with colleges, and Gregory Vaughn, whose tragic death in the 1980s exposed the underground world of drugs in basketball. Forget about the NBA and showtime. Pickup basketball is about basketball on the blacktops, at its most basic level. Itâ€™s about the unusual lives of some of the nationâ€™s best players youâ€™ve never heard of. Until now.","Sports,Sports,Sports,Basketball",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171471491l/100900.jpg,1859842437,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100900.Pickup_Artists,214,Pickup Artists: Street Basketball in America,100

Martin  Gilbert,Hardcover,"From one of our most distinguished historians, an authoritative and vivid account of the devastating World War I battle that claimed more than 300,000 lives,At 7:30 am on July 1, 1916, the first Allied soldiers climbed out of their trenches along the Somme River in France and charged out into no-man's-land toward the barbed wire and machine guns at the German front lines. ,By the end of this first day of the Allied attack, the British army alone would lose 20,000 men; in the coming months, the fifteen-mile-long territory along the river would erupt into the epicenter of the Great War. The Somme would mark a turning point in both the war and military history, as soldiers saw the first appearance of tanks on the battlefield, the emergence of the air war as a devastating and decisive factor in battle, and more than one million casualties (among them a young Adolf Hitler, who took a fragment in the leg). In just 138 days, 310,000 men died.,In this vivid, deeply researched account of one history's most destructive battles, historian Martin Gilbert tracks the Battle of the Somme through the experiences of footsoldiers (known to the British as the PBI, for Poor Bloody Infantry), generals, and everyone in between. Interwoven with photographs, journal entries, original maps, and documents from every stage and level of planning, ,The Somme, is the most authoritative and affecting account of this bloody turning point in the Great War.","History,War,World War I,Nonfiction,War,Military,Military History,War,Military Fiction,Earth,The World,Unfinished",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312052345l/100902.jpg,805081275,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100902.The_Somme,352,The Somme: Heroism and Horror in the First World War,20

Evie Shockley,Hardcover,"Smart, grounded, and lyrical, Evie Shockley's the new black integrates powerful ideas about ""blackness,"" past and present, through the medium of beautifully crafted verse. the new black sees our racial past inevitably shaping our contemporary moment, but struggles to remember and reckon with the impact of generational shifts: what seemed impossible to people not many years ago--for example, the election of an African American president--will have always been a part of the world of children born in the new millennium. All of the poems here, whether sonnet, mesostic, or deconstructed blues, exhibit a formal flair. They speak to the changes we have experienced as a society in the last few decades--changes that often challenge our past strategies for resisting racism and, for African Americans, ways of relating to one another. The poems embrace a formal ambiguity that echoes the uncertainty these shifts produce, while reveling in language play that enables readers to ""laugh to keep from crying."" They move through nostalgia, even as they insist on being alive to the present and point longingly towards possible futures.",Poetry,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1341690795l/10090630.jpg,819571407,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10090630-the-new-black,104,The New Black,109

"Rudolf Steiner,C. Von Arnim",Paperback,"During the early twelfth century, the Knights Templar were established, allegedly, to protect Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. In the process, the knights became famous for their pioneer banking system, crusading zeal, and strict vows of obedience, chastity, and poverty. As membership grew to around 15,000, they came to be seen as a threat by Philippe le Beau of France, who disbanded the group in 1307 and tortured their leaders for confessions of heretical practices. King Philippe accused the order of heresy, sodomy, and blasphemy. , Recent fictional works and popular histories have created a renewed interest in the mysterious Knights Templar, with numerous contradictory and fantastic claims made about them, thus adding to the enigma surrounding the warrior monks of France. , In this unique collection of lectures and writings by Rudolf Steiner, a new perspective emerges. Based on his spiritual perceptions, he speaks of the Templars' connection to the esoteric tradition of St. John and the Holy Grail and their spiritual dedication to Christ. He describes a secret order within the Templars and their strange rituals. He also sheds light on the Templars' attitude toward the Roman Church and the spiritual forces that inspired their torture and confessions.",History,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347618756l/1009095.jpg,1855841797,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009095.The_Knights_Templar,164,The Knights Templar: The Mystery of the Warrior Monks,136

"Martin Lowenthal,Tenzin Wangyal",Paperback,"Retreats in darkness have been used by all the great spiritual traditions for thousands of years as a method for tapping deep clarity, accessing sacred wisdom, connecting with the Divine, and training to transform the mind/body system into a manifestation of wisdom. In dark retreat, the practitioner lives in complete darkness--eating, sleeping, meditating, and simply existing in a world without external light.,Traditionally, in Tibet, dark retreats were performed by monks as part of their training with the support of their monastery and their fellow monks. But dark retreats are of value to people from all walks of life, from the monastic to the busy householder--those with jobs, families, and all-too-many responsibilities. Martin Lowenthal has taken a practice little-known in the West and made it accessible by incorporating methods based in western psychology with traditional Tibetan Buddhism.,There are many advantages of a retreat in the dark, one of which is rest for our eyes, weary from overstimulation in our visually oriented world, that then promotes overall relaxation of body and mind. This relaxation helps us cut through old mental and emotional habits, harmonizes the elements in the body, works with visions, and rests in the ""Natural State."",Retreats in the dark also improve the quality of our daily life. We can develop greater clarity and awareness in every aspect of living. When we improve the conditions of our lives, we provide an atmosphere more conducive to continued meditation practices. Dark retreat is also a powerful setting for practicing tantra. Tantra uses imagination, senses, and creativity to transform experience into food for the spirit.,Dawning of Clear Light, is a celebration, a joyous invitation to find the treasures that are hidden within your world and the world around you.","Religion,Buddhism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348051031l/1009105.jpg,1571743758,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009105.Dawning_of_Clear_Light,224,Dawning of Clear Light: A Western Approach to Tibetan Dark Retreat Meditation,95

Martin Middlebrook,Hardcover,"After an immense but useless bombardment, at 7.30 am. On 1 July 1916 the British Army went over the top and attacked the German trenches. It was the first day of the battle of the Somme, and on that day the British suffered nearly 60,000 casualties, two for every yard of their front. With more than fifty times the daily losses at El Alamein and fifteen times the British casualties on D-day, 1 July 1916 was the blackest day in the history of the British Army. But, more than that, it was a watershed in the history of the First World War. The Army that attacked on that day was the volunteer Army that had answered Kitchener's call. It had gone into action confident of a decisive victory. But by sunset on the first day on the Somme, no one could any longer think of a war that might be won. After that it was a struggle that had simply to be endured. ,Martin Middlebrook's research has covered not just official and regimental histories and tours of the battlefields, but interviews with hundreds of survivors, both British and German. As to the action itself, he conveys the overall strategic view and the terrifying reality of an new kind of war for front-line soldiers.","History,War,World War I,Nonfiction,War,Military,Military History,War,Military Fiction,Literature,20th Century,Historical,History,European History,European Literature,British Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348227877l/100911.jpg,1844154653,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100911.The_First_Day_on_the_Somme,365,The First Day on the Somme,68

Teams of volunteer ministers offer aid at disaster sites like Haiti and the World Trade Center. But Scientology is also a very closed faith, harassing journalists and others thru litigation & intimidation, even infiltrating high levels of the government to further its goals. Its attacks on psychiatry & its requirement that believers pay as much as tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars for salvation have drawn scrutiny and skepticism.

Wilkie Collins,Hardcover,"Having previously tried my hand at short serial stories (collected and reprinted in After Dark, and The Queen of Hearts), I ventured on my first attempt, in this book, to produce a sustained work of fiction, intended for periodical publication during many successive weeks. The experiment proved successful both in this country and in America. Two of the characters which appear in these pages -- ""Rosamond,"" and ""Uncle Joseph"" -- had the good fortune to find friends everywhere who took a hearty liking to them. A more elaborately drawn personage in the story -- ""Sarah Leeson"" -- was, I think, less generally understood. The idea of tracing, in this character, the influence of a heavy responsibility on a naturally timid woman, whose mind was neither strong enough to bear it, nor bold enough to drop it altogether, was a favorite idea with me, at the time, and is so much a favorite still, that I privately give ""Sarah Leeson"" the place of honor in the little portrait-gallery which my story contains. Perhaps, in saying this, I am only acknowledging, in other words, that the parents of literary families share the well-known inconsistencies of parents in general, and are sometimes unreasonably fond of the child who has always given them the most trouble. -- Wilkie Collins, _January, 1861_","Classics,Mystery,Fiction,Gothic,Historical,Victorian,Literature,19th Century,European Literature,British Literature,Literature,Suspense,Classics,Classic Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348980698l/1009216.jpg,809599171,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009216.The_Dead_Secret,340,The Dead Secret,126

"Benjamin Radford,Joe Nickell,Loren Coleman",Hardcover,"For centuries, eyewitnesses around the world -- from America to Africa, Argentina to Scotland -- have reported sightings of dark, mysterious creatures in area lakes that surface briefly, only to quickly disappear. While the most famous lake monsters of Loch Ness and Lake Champlain have gained international notoriety, hundreds of lakes around the world are said to shelter these shadowy creatures. Lake Monster Mysteries is the first book to examine these widespread mysteries from a scientific perspective. By using exhaustive research and results from firsthand investigations to help separate truth from myth, the authors foster our understanding of what really lurks in the cold, murky depths. Benjamin Radford and Joe Nickell are considered to be among the top lake monster authorities in the world. Here they share unique insights into many of the world's best-known lake monsters. They interview witnesses and local experts and discuss the different types of lake monster sightings, delve into possible explanations for those sightings, and examine hoaxes, evidence claims, and legends surrounding the monsters. The authors have also conducted groundbreaking fieldwork and experiments at the lakes and have examined recent photographic and sonar evidence. Incorporating newly-revealed information and up-to-date developments in the cases they present, professional monster hunters Radford and Nickell plunge into both the cultural histories of these creatures and the scientific inquiries that may hold the key to these mysteries.","Pseudoscience,Cryptozoology,Nonfiction,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348080000l/1009220.jpg,813123941,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009220.Lake_Monster_Mysteries,190,Lake Monster Mysteries: Investigating the World's Most Elusive Creatures,130

"Kitty Dukakis,Larry Tye",Hardcover,"An important and powerful book about electroconvulsive therapy and its comeback. , For more than twenty years, Kitty Dukakis battled severe depression with every medication and treatment available. But it wasn't until she tried electroconvulsive therapy- ECT-that she began getting her life back for good. Written with award-winning medical reporter Larry Tye, ,Shock, is both the personal story of how ECT dramatically changed Kitty Dukakis's life as well as a captivating look at the science behind ECT, the controversy surrounding it, and the history of its intriguing rebirth in this country. , ,Shock, explores the stigma afflicting ECT-still a treatment that many hospitals do not administer-and debunks long-held misconceptions about how it is performed. Though some continue to view ECT as a dangerous, even barbaric, procedure, as this book explains there is no scientific evidence to suggest that ECT damages the brain. It can cause side effects like memory loss, but they generally are not far-reaching or long-lasting, especially when newer, lower-impact techniques are employed. In fact, the U.S. surgeon general and the National Institutes of Health agree that for severe depression ECT is safe, and often more effective than antidepressants or psychotherapy. , An eye-opening and powerful book about one of the most contentious medical treatments in history, Shock demystifies ECT and brings to life-through Kitty Dukakis's moving account -its impressive capacity to heal.

Mary Saaler,Paperback,"Many possible brides were hesitant to marry Henry VIII, a man notorious for his treatment of previous wives. Because no woman emerged as the obvious choice, Thomas Cromwell's assessment of the religious and political pressures of the late 1530s led him to suggest one of the two daughters of the safely Protestant Duke of Cleves as a prospective bride. Anne was chosen, largely on the basis of her portrait, and traveled quickly to England to be Henry's new queen. The marriage, like Henry's others, was not a success and after a brief reign of just six months, Anne was 'a queen unqueened'. However she was still alive, divorced and wealthy and, unlike other portraits, this book covers her many succeeding years of independence. This is the fascinating story of one of the most powerful women in 16th Century Europe, and also an intriguing portrait of a loveless marriage.","History,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180202254l/1009383.jpg,948695412,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009383.Anne_of_Cleves,144,Anne of Cleves: Fourth Wife of Henry VIII,85

John Ferling,Hardcover,"No event in American history was more pivotal-or more furiously contested-than Congress's decision to declare independence in July 1776.

Michael F. Brown,Paperback,"The practical and artistic creations of native peoples permeate everyday life in settler nations, from the design elements on our clothing to the plot-lines of books we read to our children. Rarely, however, do native communities benefit materially from this use of their heritage, a situation that drives growing resistance to what some denounce as ""cultural theft."",Who Owns Native Culture?, documents the efforts of indigenous peoples to redefine heritage as a proprietary resource. Michael Brown takes readers into settings where native peoples defend what they consider their cultural property: a courtroom in Darwin, Australia, where an Aboriginal artist and a clan leader bring suit against a textile firm that infringes sacred art; archives and museums in the United States, where Indian tribes seek control over early photographs and sound recordings collected in their communities; and the Mexican state of Chiapas, site of a bioprospecting venture whose legitimacy is questioned by native-rights activists.,By focusing on the complexity of actual cases, Brown casts light on indigenous claims in diverse fields--religion, art, sacred places, and botanical knowledge. He finds both genuine injustice and, among advocates for native peoples, a troubling tendency to mimic the privatizing logic of major corporations.,The author proposes alternative strategies for defending the heritage of vulnerable native communities without blocking the open communication essential to the life of pluralist democracies. ,Who Owns Native Culture?, is a lively, accessible introduction to questions of cultural ownership, group privacy, intellectual property, and the recovery of indigenous identities.","Anthropology,Nonfiction,Academic,Grad School,Race,History,Law,Social Movements,Social Justice,Folklore,Sociology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348517588l/1009458.jpg,674016335,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009458.Who_Owns_Native_Culture,336,Who Owns Native Culture,136
"Joline Godfrey,Kit Hinrichs",Paperback,"Is your child a spendthrift? A hoarder? Or maybe, downright oblivious? Are there family money dramas you can do without? In RAISING FINANCIALLY FIT KIDS, Joline Godfrey, one of the countryâ€™s leading experts on kids, parents, and money, gives parents the secrets and knowledge she has gleaned from a decade of working with kids on financial literacy and business. At the heart of the book lies a defined set of values:Money is a tool for achieving and maintaining independence. Saving is good; accumulation for its own sake is not. Spending is best done wisely and within oneâ€™s means (though a bold purchase or investment may also be an act of wisdom). Greed is not good. Giving generously is part of oneâ€™s responsibility to the human family; shepherding wealth is an act of respectâ€”to the past and the future. Money is an energy (not a commodity) that can be used for evil or for good.Designed for adultsâ€”parents, grandparents, mentors, advisors, and educatorsâ€”concerned about raising children ages 5 to 18, RAISING FINANCIALLY FIT KIDS is centered around a developmental map covering ten specific money skills each child can master by the age of 18 to become a financially secure adult. This map gives parents a step-by-step approach to helping their kids become habitual savers, smart money mangers, and responsible decision makers. More than just a money book, RAISING FINANCIALLY FIT KIDS will help parents send their children into the world as balanced, financially stable individuals and contributing members of both their family and community.","Parenting,Economics,Finance,Nonfiction,Currency,Money,Finance,Personal Finance,Childrens,Self Help",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320525737l/1009462.jpg,1580085369,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009462.Raising_Financially_Fit_Kids,224,Raising Financially Fit Kids,139

"Abdelwahab Meddeb,Jane Kuntz",Paperback,"Talismano, is a novelistic exploration of writing seen as a hallucinatory journey through half-remembered, half-imagined citiesâ€”in particular, the city of Tunis, both as it is now, and as it once was. Walking and writing, journey and journal, mirror one another to produce a calligraphic, magical work: a palimpsest of various languages and cultures, highlighting Abdelwahab Meddebâ€™s beguiling mastery of both the Western and Islamic traditions. Meddebâ€™s journey is first and foremost a sensual one, almost decadent, where the narrator luxuriates in the Tunis of his memories and intercuts these impressions with recollections of other cities at other times, reviving the mythical figures of Arab-Islamic legend that have faded from memory in a rapidly westernizing North Africa. A fever dream situated on the knife-edge between competing cultures, ,Talismano, is a testament to the power of language to evoke, and subdue, experience.","Fiction,Cultural,Africa,Northern Africa,Tunisia,Literature,African Literature,Travel",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1423451598l/10094746.jpg,1564786293,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10094746-talismano,288,Talismano,79
Brian J. Gail,Paperback,"Â  Motherless by Brian J. Gail Brian J. Gail has written another heart pounding, page turner of a novel for Catholics who are straining to hear their Church's voice in what Pope John Paul II called ""the final confrontation between the Church and the anti-Church, the Gospel and the anti-Gospel."" Motherless takes the reader on a riveting behind-the-scenes journey around the globe to the boardrooms and laboratories where the architects of The Life Sciences Revolution are preparing Mankind's Final Solution... and into the confessionals and chanceries where the Church's response is being challenged. Father John Sweeney, pastor of a small Catholic parish on Philadelphia's storied Main Line, is drawn into an apocalyptic vortex through the lives of parishioners Maggie Kealey, Michael Burns and Joe Delgado. Without warning they are ushered through the back door of the Revolution where they discover human embryos being created in laboratories and frozen in cryogenic freezers for a global black market. It is, however, when the Revolution's ultimate destination is revealed to one of the three that Fr. Sweeney is faced with his greatest test as a pastor - guiding a soul to the Christian accountability to truth even in the face of potentially deadly consequences. Â  In Motherless, best selling Catholic author Brian J. Gail has created another spellbinding narrative that explores the ever more slippery slope of Man's technology and its existential threat to family and church. As in Fatherless, Gail's transcendent storytelling, scintillating dialogue and richly interwoven sub plots will leave readers breathless and hungry for more. Â  Brian J.

The Film Preservation Guide is designed for these organizations. It introduces film preservation to nonprofit and public institutions that have collections of motion picture film but lack information about how to take care of them. Written and produced by the National Film Preservation Foundation, the book is a primer for â€œbeginnersâ€â€”professionals trained in archival studies, librarianship, museum work, or history but unschooled in this technical specialty.,The guide grew from user workshops at Duke University and the Minnesota Historical Society. At the sessions, beginners talked with technical experts about what they needed to know in order to preserve and make available their film collections. ""Keep it simple!"" was the watchword of the discussions.,Following this advice, the guide describes methods for handling, duplicating, making available, and storing film that are practical for research institutions with limited resources. It is organized in chapters tracing the path of film through the preservation process, from acquisition to exhibition, and includes case studies, photo-illustrations prepared by the staff of George Eastman House, charts, 10-page glossary, bibliography, and index.,The Film Preservation Guide was made possible through the support of The Andrew W.

"Catharine H. Roehrig,Catharine H. Roehrig,Renee Dreyfus",Hardcover,"The female pharaoh Hatshepsut reigned for nearly twenty years during Egyptâ€™s early New Kingdom in the fifteenth century B.C. First acting as regent for her young nephew/stepson Thutmose III, she in time assumed the title of king and exercised the full powers of the throne as senior co-ruler. In accordance with Egyptian tradition, Hatshepsut was often depicted as a male king. After her death, however, monuments bearing her image were ruthlessly defaced, and her name was erased from historical accounts.Hatshepsutâ€™s rise to power and the nature of her kingship have long been debated by scholars. This fascinating period, one of immense artistic creativity, is illuminated by this volumeâ€™s rich presentation of monumental royal sculpture and reliefs, ceremonial objects, exquisite personal items for everyday use, and dazzling jewelry. Essays focus on influences from the neighboring Near East, Nubia, and the Aegean; the innovative architecture built by Hatshepsut; powerful figures in the royal court during her reign; archaeological finds from this period; and mysteries surrounding the destruction of Hatshepsutâ€™s statues and the obliteration of her name.The first in-depth treatment of the subject, ,From Queen to Pharoah ,is an important investigation into the impact of Hatshepsutâ€™s reign on the history, culture, and artistic output of Egypt.","History,Northern Africa,Egypt,Nonfiction,Biography,Art,Art,Art History,Archaeology,Egyptology,Literature,Ancient,Reference",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328870048l/1009560.jpg,300111398,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009560.Hatshepsut,356,Hatshepsut: From Queen to Pharaoh,14

Wendy Bellion,Hardcover,"In this richly illustrated study, the first book-length exploration of illusionistic art in the early United States, Wendy Bellion investigates Americans' experiences with material forms of visual deception and argues that encounters with illusory art shaped their understanding of knowledge, representation, and subjectivity between 1790 and 1825. Focusing on the work of the well-known Peale family and their Philadelphia Museum, as well as other Philadelphians, Bellion explores the range of illusions encountered in public spaces, from trompe l'oeil paintings and drawings at art exhibitions to ephemeral displays of phantasmagoria, Invisible Ladies, and other spectacles of deception. ,Bellion reconstructs the elite and vernacular sites where such art and objects appeared and argues that early national exhibitions doubled as spaces of citizen formation. Within a post-Revolutionary culture troubled by the social and political consequences of deception, keen perception signified able citizenship. Setting illusions into dialogue with Enlightenment cultures of science, print, politics, and the senses, ,Citizen Spectator, demonstrates that pictorial and optical illusions functioned to cultivate but also to confound discernment. Bellion reveals the equivocal nature of illusion during the early republic, mapping its changing forms and functions, and uncovers surprising links between early American art, culture, and citizenship.","Art,Art History,Art,Archaeology,Material Culture,Literature,19th Century",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398024767l/10096293.jpg,807833886,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10096293-citizen-spectator,351,"Citizen Spectator: Art, Illusion, and Visual Perception in Early National America",54

Sena Jeter Naslund,Hardcover,"
  ,""Like everyone, I am born naked."",
  ,
  ,
,With this opening line of Naslund's compelling new novel, a very human Marie Antoinette invites readers to live her story as she herself experiences it. From the lush gardens of Versailles to the lights and gaiety of Paris, the verdant countryside of France, and finally the stark and terrifying isolation of a prison cell, the young queen's life is joyful, poignant, and harrowing by turns. As her world of unprecedented royal splendor crumbles, the charming Marie Antoinette matures into a heroine of inspiring stature, one whose nobility arises not from the circumstance of her birth but from her courageous spirit.,Marie Antoinette was a child of fourteen when her mother, the Empress of Austria, arranged for her to leave her family and her country to become the wife of the fifteen-year-old Dauphin, the future King of France. Coming of age in the most public of arenas, the young queen embraces her new family and the French people, and she is embraced in return. Eager to be a good wife and strong queen, she shows her new husband nothing but love and encouragement, though he repeatedly fails to consummate their marriage and in doing so, fails to give her the thing sheâ€”and the people of Franceâ€”desires most: a child and an heir to the throne.,Deeply disappointed and isolated in her own intimate circle apart from the social life of the court, the queen allows herself to remain ignorant of the country's growing economic and political crises. She entrusts her soul to her women friends, her music teacher, her hairdresser, the ambassador from Austria, and a certain Swedish count so handsome that admirers label him ""the Picture."" When her innocent and well-chaperoned pilgrimage to watch the sun rise is viciously misrepresented in satiric pamphlets as a drunken orgy, the people begin to turn against her. Poor harvests, bitter winters, war debts, and poverty precipitate rebellion and revenge as the royal family and many nobles are caught up in a murderous time known as ""the Terror."",With penetrant insight into new historical scholarship and with wondrous narrative skill, Naslund offers an intimate, fresh, and dramatic re-creation of this compelling woman that goes beyond popular myth. ,Abundance, reveals a compassionate and spontaneous Marie Antoinette who rejected the formality and rigid protocol of the court; an enchanting and tenderhearted outsider who was loved by her adopted homeland and people until she became the target of revolutionary cruelty and violence; a dethroned queen whose depth of character sustained her in even the worst of times.,Once again, Sena Jeter Naslund has shed new light on an important moment of historical change and made that time as real to us as the one we are living now. Exquisitely detailed, beautifully written, heartbreaking and powerful, ,Abundance, is a novel that is impossible to put down.","Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Cultural,France,Historical,European History,French Revolution,Literature,18th Century,Audiobook,Book Club,Novels,Adult Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441248188l/100967._SY475_.jpg,60825391,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100967.Abundance,556,Abundance,15

John Guy,Hardcover,"A long-overdue and dramatic reinterpretation of the life of Mary, Queen of Scots by one of the leading historians at work today.,She was crowned Queen of Scotland at nine months of age, and Queen of France at sixteen years; at eighteen she ascended the throne that was her birthright and began ruling one of the most fractious courts in Europe, riven by religious conflict and personal lust for power. She rode out at the head of an army in both victory and defeat; saw her second husband assassinated, and married his murderer. At twenty-five she entered captivity at the hands of her rival queen, from which only death would release her.,The life of Mary Stuart is one of unparalleled drama and conflict. From the labyrinthine plots laid by the Scottish lords to wrest power for themselves, to the efforts made by Elizabeth's ministers to invalidate Mary's legitimate claim to the English throne, John Guy returns to the archives to explode the myths and correct the inaccuracies that surround this most fascinating monarch. He also explains a central mystery: why Mary would have consented to marry â€“ only three months after the death of her second husband, Lord Darnley â€“ the man who was said to be his killer, the Earl of Bothwell. And, more astonishingly, he solves, through careful re-examination of the Casket Letters, the secret behind Darnley's spectacular assassination at Kirk o'Field. With great pathos, Guy illuminates how the imprisoned Mary's despair led to a reckless plot against Elizabeth â€“ and thus to her own execution.,The portrait that emerges is not of a political pawn or a manipulative siren, but of a shrewd and charismatic young ruler who relished power and, for a time, managed to hold together a fatally unstable country.","History,Nonfiction,Biography,Cultural,Scotland,Historical,English History,Tudor Period,European Literature,British Literature,Biography Memoir,History,European History,Cultural,France",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439169103l/10097._SY475_.jpg,618254110,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10097.Queen_of_Scots,581,Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart,42

Ashwin Sanghi,Paperback,"The year is 340 BC. A hunted, haunted Brahmin youth vows revenge for the gruesome murder of his beloved father. Cold, calculating, cruel and armed with a complete absence of accepted morals, he becomes the most powerful political strategist in Bharat and succeeds in uniting a ragged country against the invasion of the army of that demigod, Alexander the Great. Pitting the weak edges of both forces against each other, he pulls off a wicked and astonishing victory and succeeds in installing Chandragupta on the throne of the mighty Mauryan empire.,History knows him as the brilliant strategist Chanakya. Satisfiedâ€”and a little boredâ€”by his success as a kingmaker, through the simple summoning of his gifted mind, he recedes into the shadows to write his Arthashastra, the â€˜science of wealthâ€™. But history, which exults in repeating itself, revives Chanakya two and a half millennia later, in the avatar of Gangasagar Mishra, a Brahmin teacher in smalltown India who becomes puppeteer to a host of ambitious individualsâ€”including a certain slumchild who grows up into a beautiful and powerful woman.,Modern India happens to be just as riven as ancient Bharat by class hatred, corruption and divisive politics and this landscape is Gangasagarâ€™s feasting ground. Can this wily panditâ€”who preys on greed, venality and sexual devianceâ€”bring about another miracle of a united India? Will Chanakyaâ€™s chant work again?

Laura Leedy Gansler,Paperback,"Resurrecting a lost hero of the Civil War, ,The Mysterious Private Thompson, tells the remarkable story of Sarah Emma Edmonds (1841â€“98), who disguised herself as a man and defended her country at a time of war. Drawing on Edmonds's journals and those of the men she served with, Laura Leedy Gansler recreates Edmondsâ€™s experience in some of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, including both the First and the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Peninsula Campaign, and the Battle of Fredericksburg, during which she served with distinction in combat as a â€œmaleâ€ nurse and braved enemy fire as a mail carrier. Gansler also investigates Edmonds's claim to have been a spy, going behind enemy lines disguised as a slave (by staining her skin with silver nitrate), as a Confederate soldier, and even, ironically, as a peddler woman.,Â ,After two years of valiant service, the young soldier, who twice rejected medical attention for injuries sustained in the line of duty for fear of being discovered, was struck down with malaria. Rather than risk detection by a military doctor, â€œFranklin Thompsonâ€ disappeared and was marked down as a deserter. Twenty years later, having resumed her female identity, Edmonds emerged from obscurity to fight for her pension and reunite with her surprised former comrades, who had not known their brother-in-arms was a woman. This intimate portrait is, above all, a personal drama about the lengths one daring woman was willing to go to chart her own destiny.","History,Biography,Nonfiction,Military History,Civil War,American History,American Civil War,Historical,North American Hi...,American History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349083230l/1009936.jpg,803259883,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1009936.The_Mysterious_Private_Thompson,272,"The Mysterious Private Thompson: The Double Life of Sarah Emma Edmonds, Civil War Soldier",51

Roger Biles,Hardcover,"By the end of the twentieth century, decaying inner cities in America continued to lose ground despite the best efforts of local and federal officials. By then the investment in urban revitalization begun during the activist 1960s had become a romantic memory. Roger Biles's insightful new book shows why. The first major comprehensive treatment of the subject in thirty-five years, superseding Mark Gelfand's landmark ,A Nation of Cities,, it examines the federal government's relationship with urban America from the Truman through the Clinton administrations.,Deftly analyzing the efforts of presidents, legislators, and other policy makers to deal with a range of troubling and persistent urban issues--especially problems related to housing, transportation, and poverty--Biles chronicles the attitudes and policy proposals of each president and his chief appointees. He shows that, although various presidents announced initiatives to benefit cities, only Jimmy Carter actually made a sustained effort to do so, while the Eisenhower administration stepped back from New Deal-Fair Deal engagement in urban affairs and LBJ's Great Society programs succeeded in reviving ailing cities--until money was diverted to the Vietnam war. Biles explains how Ronald Reagan's New Federalism reduced the federal government's presence in urban America with a vengeance and how Bill Clinton's Third Way for America's cities signaled yet another triumph for devolution and decentralization. He also critiques the Department of Housing and Urban Development, citing its ongoing inability to serve as a strong advocate for the cities within the federal government.,Well organized, clearly written, and wide-ranging, Biles's impressive treatise provides a telling critique of how in the long run the government turned a blind eye to the fate of the cities. No other work offers such a useful narrative of presidential action or inaction and Washington political maneuvering with regard to urban issues. This comprehensive history will become the standard source for understanding the development and trajectory of federal policy making affecting America's urban centers.","Cities,Urban Studies,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348723973l/10099518.jpg,070061768X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10099518-the-fate-of-cities,462,"The Fate of Cities: Urban America and the Federal Government, 1945-2000",110

So Reinhart, with his decades of experience crafting amazing artisanal breads, has made it his mission to create whole grain breads that are nothing short of incredible. ,In this follow-up to his award-winning book ,The Bread Bakerâ€™s Apprentice,, Reinhart offers groundbreaking methods for making whole grain breads that taste better than any youâ€™ve ever had. And because his approach is also simpler and less labor intensive than conventional techniques, youâ€™ll ,choose, to make and eat these breads. His fifty-five recipes for whole grain sandwich, hearth, and specialty breads, plus bagels, crackers, and more, incorporate widely available whole wheat flour as well as other flours and grains such as rye, barley, steel-cut oats, cornmeal, and quinoa. Each is so rich with flavor and satisfying texture that white-flour counterparts pale in comparison.,Written in Reinhartâ€™s famously clear style and accompanied by inspiring photographs, these recipes were perfected with the help of nearly 350 testers.

Andrew J. Nicholson,Hardcover,"Some postcolonial theorists argue that the idea of a single system of belief known as ""Hinduism"" is a creation of nineteenth-century British imperialists. Andrew J. Nicholson introduces another perspective: although a unified Hindu identity is not as ancient as some Hindus claim, it has its roots in innovations within South Asian philosophy from the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries. During this time, thinkers treated the philosophies of Vedanta, Samkhya, and Yoga, along with the worshippers of Visnu, Siva, and Sakti, as belonging to a single system of belief and practice. Instead of seeing such groups as separate and contradictory, they re-envisioned them as separate rivers leading to the ocean of Brahman, the ultimate reality.,Drawing on the writings of philosophers from late medieval and early modern traditions, including Vijnanabhiksu, Madhava, and Madhusudana Sarasvati, Nicholson shows how influential thinkers portrayed Vedanta philosophy as the ultimate unifier of diverse belief systems. This project paved the way for the work of later Hindu reformers, such as Vivekananda, Radhakrishnan, and Gandhi, whose teachings promoted the notion that all world religions belong to a single spiritual unity. In his study, Nicholson also critiques the way in which Eurocentric concepts--like monism and dualism, idealism and realism, theism and atheism, and orthodoxy and heterodoxy--have come to dominate modern discourses on Indian philosophy.","Nonfiction,Religion,Hinduism,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349080524l/10100550.jpg,231149867,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10100550-unifying-hinduism,266,Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History,77

George RudÃ©,Paperback,"What kinds of people were in the crowds that stormed the Bastille, marched to Versailles to bring the king and queen back to Paris, overthrew the monarchy in August 1792, or impassively witnessed the downfall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor? Who led these crowds or mobilized them to action? What did they hope to achieve, and how far were their aims realized? Earlier historians have tended to view the revolutionary crowd as an abstraction--people or mob according to the writer's prejudice--often even as the personification of good or evil. Professor Rudï¿½'s book, published originally in 1959, makes a first attempt to bring objectively to life each of the important Parisian crowds between 1787 and 1795. Using police records and other contemporary research materials, the author identifies the social groups represented in them, contrasts the crowds with their political leaders, relates their activities to underlying economic and psychological tensions, and compares the Parisian crowd patterns to those of other popular movements in France and Britain during the 18th and early 19th centuries.","History,European History,French Revolution,Cultural,France,Sociology,History,European History,Nonfiction,Literature,18th Century",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348042706l/1010126.jpg,195003705,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1010126.The_Crowd_in_the_French_Revolution,269,The Crowd in the French Revolution,72

One of France's great historians analyzes the causes of the mass hysteria that overcame rural France during the summer of 1789, as hungry villagers flocked into towns to look for work or to beg for charity, and as vagrants and beggars choked the rural roads, threatening reprisals against householders who refused to give them shelter or a crust of bread.,Originally published in 1983.,The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

"Francis X. Blouin,William G. Rosenberg",Hardcover,"Processing the Past ,explores the dramatic changes taking place in historical understanding and archival management, and hence the relations between historians and archivists. Written by an archivist and a historian, it shows how these changes have been brought on by new historical thinking, new conceptions of archives, changing notions of historical authority, modifications in archival practices, and new information technologies. The book takes an archival turn by situating archives as subjects rather than places of study, and examining the increasingly problematic relationships between historical and archival work.,By showing how nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historians and archivists in Europe and North America came to occupy the same conceptual and methodological space, the book sets the background to these changes. In the past, authoritative history was based on authoritative archives and mutual understandings of scientific research. These connections changed as historians began to ask questions not easily answered by traditional documentation, and archivists began to confront an unmanageable increase in the amount of material they processed and the challenges of new electronic technologies. ,The authors contend that historians and archivists have divided into two entirely separate professions with distinct conceptual frameworks, training, and purposes, as well as different understandings of the authorities that govern their work. ,Processing the Past ,moves toward bridging this divide by speaking in one voice to these very different audiences. Blouin and Rosenberg conclude by raising the worrisome question of what future historical archives might be like if historical scholars and archivists no longer understand each other, and indeed, whether their now different notions of what is archival and historical will ever again be joined.","History,Nonfiction,Textbooks,Philosophy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347363220l/10101750.jpg,199740542,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10101750-processing-the-past,272,Processing the Past: Contesting Authority in History and the Archives,13

They became medical celebrities: every week, eager crowds arrived at the hospital to observe their symptoms; they were photographed, sculpted, painted, and transformed into characters in novels. The remarkable story of their lives as patients in the clinic is a strange amalgam of intimate details and public exposure, science and religion, medicine and the occult, hypnotism, love, and theater. ,But who were Blanche, Augustine, and GeneviÃ¨ve? What role did they play in their own peculiar form of stardom? And what exactly were they suffering from?

Alexa Albert,Paperback,"When Harvard medical student Alexa Albert conducted a public-health study as the Mustang Ranch brothel in Nevada, the only state in the union where prostitution is legal, neither she nor the brothel could have predicted the end result. Having worked with homeless prostitutes in Times Square, Albert was intimate with human devastation cause by the sex trade, and curious to see if Nevadaâ€™s brothels offered a less harmful model for a business that will always be with us. The Mustang Ranch has never before given an outsider such access, but fear of AIDS was hurting the business, and the Ranch was eager to get publicity for its rigorous standards of sexual hygiene. Albert was drawn into the lives of the women of the Mustang Ranch, and what began as a public-health project evolved into something more intimate and ambitious, a six-year study of the brothel ecosystem, its lessons and significance. ,The women of the Mustang Ranch poured their stories out to Albert: how they came to be there, their surprisingly deep sense of craft and vocation, how they reconciled their profession with life on the outside. Dr. Albert went as far into this world as it is possible to go â€” some will say too far â€” including sitting in on sessions with customers, and the result is a book that puts an unforgettable face on Americaâ€™s maligned and caricatured subculture.,From the Hardcover edition.","Nonfiction,Sociology,Feminism,Sexuality,Sexuality,Sex Work,History,Sex Work,Prostitution,Biography,Womens,Psychology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320396742l/101027.jpg,449006581,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101027.Brothel,272,Brothel: Mustang Ranch and Its Women,9

Peter N. Stearns,Paperback,"The industrial revolution is generally recognized as a major development in world history. Even so, the study of it is routinely handled as simply part of Western European history or as part of individual national histories. Peter N. Stearns offers a genuinely world-historical approach, looking at the international factors that touched off the industrial revolution and at its global spread and impact. In this revised third edition, ,The Industrial Revolution in World History, begins with an examination of industrialization in the West, but it also treats later cases in other societies-including Japan, Russia, and the United States, as well as newly revised sections on Asia and Latin America-providing the comparative analysis usually lacking in single-nation treatments. Although the text defines the essence of industrialization in terms of technology and economic organization, it pays substantial attention to larger social results, especially changes in the experience of work and shifts in family functions and gender roles. Including a new chapter on global environmental impact, ,The Industrial Revolution in World History, seeks to build on recent scholarly advances to include a more fully international and human perspective in our understanding of the industrial revolution. The third edition also features fully revised sections on globalization, causation, and non-Western societies, further strengthening Stearns' discussion of complex industrial and international trends.","History,History,World History,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348026311l/1010296.jpg,813343607,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1010296.The_Industrial_Revolution_in_World_History,336,The Industrial Revolution in World History,74

SiÃ¢n Rees,Hardcover,"A seafaring story with a twist -- the incredible voyage of a shipload of ""disorderly girls"" and the men who transported them, fell for them, and sold them.,This riveting work of rediscovered history tells for the first time the plight of the female convicts aboard the ,Lady Julian,, which set sail from England in 1789 and arrived in Australia's Botany Bay a year later. The women, most of them petty criminals, were destined for New South Wales to provide its hordes of lonely men with sexual favors as well as progeny. But the story of their voyage is even more incredible, and here it is expertly told by a historian with roots in the boatbuilding business and a true love of the sea.,SiÃ¢n Rees delved into court documents and firsthand accounts to extract the stories of these women's experiences on board a ship that both held them prisoner and offered them refuge from their oppressive existence in London. At the heart of the story is the passionate relationship between Sarah Whitelam, a convict, and the ship's steward, John Nicol, whose personal journals provided much of the material for this book. Along the way, Rees brings the vibrant, bawdy world of London -- and the sights, smells, and sounds of an eighteenth-century ship -- vividly to life.

Combining empirically-based and analytic chapters, it attempts to explain the causes of the escalation in violence, the various actors, levels and dynamics involved, and the policy challenges faced with regard to conflict management/resolution and the options for peace.

Mark Kurlansky,Hardcover,"From the prizewinning Jewish Lives series, the remarkable life story of the first Jewish superstar athlete, by ,New York Times, best-selling author Mark Kurlansky,One of the reasons baseball fans so love the sport is that it involves certain physical acts of beauty. And one of the most beautiful sights in the history of baseball was Hank Greenberg's swing. His calmly poised body seemed to have some special set of springs with a trigger release that snapped his arms and swept the bat through the air with the clean speed and strength of a propeller. But what is even more extraordinary than his grace and his power is that in Detroit of 1934, his swingâ€”or its absenceâ€”became entwined with American Jewish history. Though Hank Greenberg was one of the first players to challenge Babe Ruth's single-season record of sixty home runs, it was the game Greenberg did not play for which he is best remembered. With his decision to sit out a 1934 game between his Tigers and the New York Yankees because it fell on Yom Kippur, Hank Greenberg became a hero to Jews throughout America. Yet, as Kurlansky writes, he was the quintessential secular Jew, and to celebrate him for his loyalty to religious observance is to ignore who this man was.,In ,Hank Greenberg, Mark Kurlansky explores the truth behind the slugger's legend: his Bronx boyhood, his spectacular discipline as an aspiring ballplayer, the complexity of his decision not to play on Yom Kippur, and the cultural context of virulent anti-Semitism in which his career played out.,What Kurlansky discovers is a man of immense dignity and restraint with a passion for sport who became a great readerâ€”a man, too, who was an inspiration to the young Jackie Robinson, who said, ""Class tells. It sticks out all over Mr. Greenberg.""","Sports,Baseball,Sports,Sports,Biography,Nonfiction,History,Religion,Judaism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328826424l/10103175.jpg,300136609,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10103175-hank-greenberg,192,Hank Greenberg: The Hero Who Didn't Want to Be One,27
"Jan MacKell,Thomas J. Noel",Hardcover,"Prostitution thrived in pioneer Colorado. Mining was the principal occupation and men outnumbered women more than twenty to one. Jan MacKell provides a detailed overview of the business between 1860 and 1930, focusing her research on the mining towns of Cripple Creek, Salida, Colorado City, and similar boomtown communities. She used census data, Sanborn maps, city directories, property records, marriage records, and court records to document and trace the movements of the women over the course of their careers, uncovering work histories, medical problems, and numerous relocations from town to town. She traces many to their graves, through years filled with abuse, disease, narcotics, and violence. MacKell has unearthed numerous colourful and often touching stories, like that of the boy raised in a brothel who was invited to play with a neighbour's children and replied, No, my mother is a whore and says I am to stay at home.","History,Nonfiction,Westerns,Sexuality,Sex Work",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391307985l/101031.jpg,826333427,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101031.Brothels_Bordellos_Bad_Girls,310,"Brothels, Bordellos, & Bad Girls: Prostitution in Colorado, 1860-1930",97
Corey Taylor,Hardcover,"For the first time, Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor speaks directly to his fans and shares his worldview about life as a sinner. And Taylor knows how to sin. As a small-town hero in the early '90s, he threw himself into a fierce-drinking, drug-abusing, hard-loving, live-for-the moment life. Soon Taylor's music exploded, and he found himself rich, wanted, and on the road. His new and ever-more extreme lifestyle had an unexpected effect, however; for the first time, he began to actively think about what it meant to sin and whether sinning could--or should--be recast in a different light. ,Seven Deadly Sins, is Taylor's personal story, but it's also a larger discussion of what it means to be seen as either a ""good"" person or a ""bad"" one.

Here, too, are the offstage voices--Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine and John Adams from Europe. ,In all, fifty-five men attended; and in spite of the heat, in spite of clashing interests--the big states against the little, the slave states against the anti-slave states--in tension and anxiety that mounted week after week, they wrote out a working plan of government and put their signatures to it.","History,North American Hi...,American History,Politics,Military History,American Revolution,Nonfiction,Law,Historical,Literature,American,Academic,Read For School,American Revolution,American Revolutionary War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441169729l/101065._SY475_.jpg,316103985,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101065.Miracle_at_Philadelphia,346,"Miracle at Philadelphia: The Story of the Constitutional Convention, May to September 1787",78

But much less attention has been paid to his monarchy, especially the closing years of his reign.,Rich with information including details from new archival material and written with the nail-biting suspense of a modern thriller, ,The Last Days of Henry VIII, offers a superb fresh look at this fascinating figure and new insight into an intriguing chapter in history.,Robert Hutchinson paints a brilliant portrait of this egotistical tyrant who governed with a ruthlessness that rivals that of modern dictators; a monarch who had ""no respect or fear of anyone in this world,"" according to the Spanish ambassador to his court. Henry VIII pioneered the modern ""show trial"": cynical propaganda exercises in which the victims were condemned before the proceedings even opened, proving the most powerful men in the land could be brought down overnight.,After thirty-five years in power, Henry was a bloated, hideously obese, black-humored old recluse. And despite his having had six wives, the Tudor dynasty rested on the slight shoulders of his only male heir, the nine-year-old Prince Edward -- a situation that spurred rival factions into a deadly conflict to control the throne.,The Last Days of Henry VIII, is a gripping and compelling history as fascinating and remarkable as its subject.","History,Nonfiction,English History,Tudor Period,Biography,European Literature,British Literature,Biography Memoir,Historical,Historical,Medieval",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1166115525l/10107._SY475_.jpg,60837330,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10107.The_Last_Days_of_Henry_VIII,368,The Last Days of Henry VIII,78

Brian T. Edwards,Paperback,"Until attention shifted to the Middle East in the early 1970s, Americans turned most often toward the Maghrebâ€”Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and the Saharaâ€”for their understanding of â€œthe Arab.â€ In ,Morocco Bound,, Brian T. Edwards examines American representations of the Maghreb during three pivotal decadesâ€”from 1942, when the United States entered the North African campaign of World War II, through 1973. He reveals how American film and literary, historical, journalistic, and anthropological accounts of the region imagined the role of the United States in a world it seemed to dominate at the same time that they displaced domestic social concernsâ€”particularly about race relationsâ€”onto an â€œexoticâ€ North Africa.Edwards reads a broad range of texts to recuperate the disorienting possibilities for rethinking American empire. Examining work by William Burroughs, Jane Bowles, Ernie Pyle, A. J. Liebling, Jane Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Clifford Geertz, James Michener, Ornette Coleman, General George S. Patton, and others, he puts American texts in conversation with an archive of Maghrebi responses. Whether considering Warner Brothersâ€™ marketing of the movie ,Casablanca, in 1942, journalistic representations of Tangier as a city of excess and queerness, Paul Bowlesâ€™s collaboration with the Moroccan artist Mohammed Mrabet, the hippie communities in and around Marrakech in the 1960s and early 1970s, or the writings of young American anthropologists working nearby at the same time, Edwards illuminates the circulation of American texts, their relationship to Maghrebi history, and the ways they might be read so as to reimagine the role of American culture in the world.","Northern Africa,Morocco",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328864380l/1010858.jpg,822336448,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1010858.Morocco_Bound,376,"Morocco Bound: Disorienting America's Maghreb, from Casablanca to the Marrakech Express",88

Bernard Cornwell,Paperback,"Four thousand years ago, a stranger's death at the Old Temple of Ratharryn-and his ominous ""gift"" of gold-precipitates the building of what for centuries to come will be known as one of mankind's most singular and remarkable achievements. Bernard Cornwell's epic novel ,Stonehenge, catapults us into a powerful and vibrant world of ritual and sacrifice at once timeless and wholly original-a tale of patricide, betrayal, and murder; of bloody brotherly rivalry: and of the never-ending quest for power, wealth, and spiritual fulfillment.,Three brothers-deadly rivals-are uneasily united in their quest to create a temple to their gods. There is Lengar, the eldest, a ruthless warrior intent on replacing his father as chief of the tribe of Ratharryn; Camaban, his bastard brother, a sorcerer whose religious fervor inspires the plan for Stonehenge; and Saban, the youngest, through whose expertise the temple will finally be completed. Divided by blood but united-precariously-by a shared vision, the brothers begin erecting their mighty ring of granite, aligning towering stones to the movement of the heavenly bodies, and raising arches to appease and unite their gods. Caught between the zealousness of his ambitious brothers, Saban becomes the true leader of his people, a peacemaker who will live to see the temple built in the name of salvation and regeneration.,Bernard Cornwell, long admired for his rousing narrative and meticulous historical imaginings, has here delivered his masterpiece, the most compelling and powerful human drama of its kind since Ken Follett's ,Pillars of the Earth, and Edward Rutherford's ,Sarum,. His re-creation of civilization as it might have been in 2000 B.C. at once amplifies the mystery of his subject and makes the world of Stonehenge come alive as never before.","Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Historical,Fantasy,European Literature,British Literature,Adventure,Historical Fiction,Historical Fantasy,Historical Fiction,Prehistoric,History,Prehistory,Romance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1276681573l/101086.jpg,60956852,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101086.Stonehenge,578,Stonehenge,123

Christopher Chippindale,Paperback,"Since its first and prize-winning edition of 1983, ""Stonehenge Complete has established itself as the classic account of this most famous of ancient places. For this new edition, Christopher Chippindale has revised and updated the story to include the latest theories and discoveries. People have puzzled over Stonehenge for centuries, speculating and dreaming about it, drawing and painting it, trying to make sense of it. Here is the story of the one real Stonehenge, as well as the many unreal Stonehenges that archaeologists, tourists, mystics, astronomers, artists, poets, and visionaries have made out of it. New studies in the last decade have revolutionized our knowledge of the complex sequence of structures that make its celebrated profile; remarkably, these new discoveries have been made without new excavations. Stonehenge today is as lively as it ever was. After a period of dissent and confrontation, visitors are once again welcome to see the sun rise over the Heel stone on midsummer solstice day, and some 20,000 people are expected to gather at midsummer dawn this year. As the new edition explains, they are in error: although Stonehenge is indeed astronomically oriented, it is not aligned on the midsummer sunrise at all.","History,Nonfiction,History,Archaeology,Travel,European Literature,British Literature,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348230808l/101087.jpg,500284679,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101087.Stonehenge_Complete,312,Stonehenge Complete,67
Margaret George,Paperback,"This is the story of England's most famous, and notorious, king.,Henry was a charismatic, ardent - and brash - young lover who married six times; a scholar with a deep love of poetry and music; an energetic hunter who loved the outdoors; a monarch whose lack of a male heir haunted him incessantly; and a ruthless leader who would stop at nothing to achieve his desires. His monumental decision to split from Rome and the Catholic Church was one that would forever shape the religious and political landscape of Britain.,Combining magnificent storytelling with an extraordinary grasp of the pleasures and perils of power, Margaret George delivers a vivid portrait of Henry VIII and Tudor England and the powerhouse of players on its stage: Thomas Cromwell, Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas More and Anne Boleyn. It is also a narrative told from an original perspective: Margaret George writes from the King's point of view, injecting irreverent comments from Will Somers - Henry's jester and confidant.","Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Historical,English History,Tudor Period,European Literature,British Literature,Literature,16th Century,Historical,Medieval,Adult Fiction,Adult,History,European History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439956289l/10108._SY475_.jpg,312194390,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10108.The_Autobiography_of_Henry_VIII,939,"The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes by His Fool, Will Somers",137

Ben Okri,Paperback,"In the decade since it won the Booker Prize, Ben Okri's ,Famished Road, has become a classic. Like Salman Rushdie's ,Midnight's Children, or Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ,One Hundred Years of Solitude,, it combines brilliant narrative technique with a fresh vision to create an essential work of world literature.,The narrator, Azaro, is an ,abiku,, a spirit child, who in the Yoruba tradition of Nigeria exists between life and death. The life he foresees for himself and the tale he tells is full of sadness and tragedy, but inexplicably he is born with a smile on his face. Nearly called back to the land of the dead, he is resurrected. But in their efforts to save their child, Azaro's loving parents are made destitute. The tension between the land of the living, with its violence and political struggles, and the temptations of the carefree kingdom of the spirits propels this latter-day Lazarus's story.","Fiction,Cultural,Africa,Magical Realism,Fantasy,Western Africa,Nigeria,Literature,African Literature,Literary Fiction,Literature,Novels,Contemporary",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344396715l/101094.jpg,385425139,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101094.The_Famished_Road,512,The Famished Road,93

"Max H. Bazerman,Ann E. Tenbrunsel",Hardcover,"When confronted with an ethical dilemma, most of us like to think we would stand up for our principles. But we are not as ethical as we think we are. In ,Blind Spots,, leading business ethicists Max Bazerman and Ann Tenbrunsel examine the ways we overestimate our ability to do what is right and how we act unethically without meaning to. From the collapse of Enron and corruption in the tobacco industry, to sales of the defective Ford Pinto, the downfall of Bernard Madoff, and the Challenger space shuttle disaster, the authors investigate the nature of ethical failures in the business world and beyond, and illustrate how we can become more ethical, bridging the gap between who we are and who we want to be.,Explaining why traditional approaches to ethics don't work, the book considers how blind spots like ethical fading--the removal of ethics from the decision--making process--have led to tragedies and scandals such as the ,Challenger, space shuttle disaster, steroid use in Major League Baseball, the crash in the financial markets, and the energy crisis. The authors demonstrate how ethical standards shift, how we neglect to notice and act on the unethical behavior of others, and how compliance initiatives can actually promote unethical behavior. They argue that scandals will continue to emerge unless such approaches take into account the psychology of individuals faced with ethical dilemmas. Distinguishing our should self (the person who knows what is correct) from our want self (the person who ends up making decisions), the authors point out ethical sinkholes that create questionable actions.,Suggesting innovative individual and group tactics for improving human judgment, ,Blind Spots, shows us how to secure a place for ethics in our workplaces, institutions, and daily lives.","Psychology,Nonfiction,Business,Philosophy,Self Help,Personal Development,Leadership,Social Science,Science,Self Help",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340740148l/10110222.jpg,691147507,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10110222-blind-spots,191,Blind Spots: Why We Fail to Do What's Right and What to Do about It,25

Edward Maeder,Hardcover,"Since their earliest days, the movies have been concerned with historical and Biblical subjects. The first cinematic genius, D.W. Griffith, turned for his greatest themes to the Civil War, the French Revolution and ancient Babylon. Then came the era of Cecil B. De Mille's extravaganzas, drawing on the Bible, the 'wickedness' of ancient Rome, and early America. , The L.A. County Museum of Art possesses by far the most important collection of costumes made for Hollywood films. In addition, its archives hold an enormous assortment of designers' costume sketches from all the movie studios, as well as a treasure-house of stills. ,In this absorbing volume, Edward Maeder, Curator of Costumes and Textiles at the Museum, examines the social and economic conditions reflected in the changing tastes of the cinema. Alicia Annas contributes a section on make-up and hairstyles; and Satch LaValley writes about the historical film and retail fashion. ,With an extensive filmography which describes the costumes in hundreds of period films, and with nearly 300 illustrations, this book offers an unparalleled record of this endlessly fascinating phenomenon.

Sarah Berry,Hardcover,"Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich -- all were icons of beauty and glamour in 1930s Hollywood. Screen Style reveals the impact of celebrities like these on women filmgoers, looking beyond the surface of the films and fashions of the era -- often described as forms of escapism from the difficult realities of the Depression -- to show how Hollywood presented women with models for self-determination during a time of rapid social change.Revealing the fascination of Hollywood movies in the thirties with strong-willed women -- from the ambitions of gold-diggers, working girls, and social climbers to the illicit appeal of female androgyny and ethnic exoticism -- Sarah Berry presents a lively, accessible, and lavishly illustrated look at films, fan magazines, and advertising. She views Hollywood glamour in the context of popular debates about fashion, identity, and social status, discussing such films as What Price Hollywood?, The Bride Wore Red, and The Bitter Tea of General Yen; big-budget, styledriven vehicles such as Fashions of 1934 and Vogues of 1938; and musicals, costume dramas, and Technicolor extravaganzas.,Screen Style explores the consumer economy that was still a novelty in the 1930s, as well as the shift from ""class"" to ""mass"" fashion marketing. Berry analyzes Hollywood and fashion-industry perceptions of the huge potential buying power of women, both as purchasers of goods for the entire family and as filmgoers, and the subsequent boom in star endorsements and merchandising, fashion publicity for upcoming films, and movie tie-ins of clothes and accessories. Wide-ranging changes accompanied the popularization of fashion, including the growing acceptance of cosmeticuse and women's appropriation of pants. The fact that more women than ever before were working outside of the home led to a blurring of the social distinctions that fashion had traditionally served to accentuate -- and, as a result, popular fashion provided women with a new tool to challenge and shape their roles in society.","Culture,Film,Couture,Fashion,Nonfiction,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180211278l/1011041.jpg,816633126,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1011041.Screen_Style,264,Screen Style: Fashion and Femininity in 1930s Hollywood,120

For on that rainy morning, the young Yale professor Hiram Bingham III climbed into the Andes Mountains of Peru and encountered an ancient city in the clouds: the now famous citadel of Machu Picchu. Nearly a century later, news reports have recast the hero explorer as a villain who smuggled out priceless artifacts and stole credit for finding one of the world's greatest archaeological sites., Mark Adams has spent his career editing adventure and travel magazines, so his plan to investigate the allegations against Bingham by retracing the explorer's perilous path to Machu Picchu isn't completely far- fetched, even if it does require him to sleep in a tent for the first time. With a crusty, antisocial Australian survivalist and several Quechua-speaking, coca-chewing mule tenders as his guides, Adams takes readers through some of the most gorgeous and historic landscapes in Peru, from the ancient Inca capital of Cusco to the enigmatic ruins of Vitcos and Vilcabamba. , Along the way he finds a still-undiscovered country populated with brilliant and eccentric characters, as well as an answer to the question that has nagged scientists since Hiram Bingham's time: Just what was Machu Picchu?, ","Travel,Nonfiction,History,Adventure,Autobiography,Memoir,Biography,Travel,Travelogue,History,Archaeology,Historical,Biography Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311704972l/10111087.jpg,525952241,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10111087-turn-right-at-machu-picchu,333,Turn Right at Machu Picchu: Rediscovering the Lost City One Step at a Time,50

"Ioan Petru Culianu,Mircea Eliade,Margaret Cook",Paperback,"It is a widespread prejudice of modern, scientific society that ""magic"" is merely a ludicrous amalgam of recipes and methods derived from primitive and erroneous notions about nature. ,Eros and Magic in the Renaissance, challenges this view, providing an in-depth scholarly explanation of the workings of magic and showing that magic continues to exist in an altered form even today.,Renaissance magic, according to Ioan Couliano, was a scientifically plausible attempt to manipulate individuals and groups based on a knowledge of motivations, particularly erotic motivations. Its key principle was that everyone (and in a sense everything) could be influenced by appeal to sexual desire. In addition, the magician relied on a profound knowledge of the art of memory to manipulate the imaginations of his subjects. In these respects, Couliano suggests, magic is the precursor of the modern psychological and sociological sciences, and the magician is the distant ancestor of the psychoanalyst and the advertising and publicity agent.,In the course of his study, Couliano examines in detail the ideas of such writers as Giordano Bruno, Marsilio Ficino, and Pico della Mirandola and illuminates many aspects of Renaissance culture, including heresy, medicine, astrology, alchemy, courtly love, the influence of classical mythology, and even the role of fashion in clothing.,Just as science gives the present age its ruling myth, so magic gave a ruling myth to the Renaissance. Because magic relied upon the use of images, and images were repressed and banned in the Reformation and subsequent history, magic was replaced by exact science and modern technology and eventually forgotten. Couliano's remarkable scholarship helps us to recover much of its original significance and will interest a wide audience in the humanities and social sciences.","History,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Religion,Fantasy,Magic,Occult,Historical,Medieval,Fantasy,Mythology,Reference,Art",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347895267l/1011154.jpg,226123162,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1011154.Eros_and_Magic_in_the_Renaissance,271,Eros and Magic in the Renaissance,22

Sylvia Nasar,Hardcover,"The author of the groundbreaking bestseller ,A Beautiful Mind, takes the reader on a journey of discoveryâ€”how the greatest invention of modern times, economics, has changed the lives of every single human being.,In a sweeping narrative, the author of the megabestseller ,A Beautiful Mind ,takes us on a journey through modern history with the men and women who changed the lives of every single person on the planet. Itâ€™s the epic story of the making of modern economics, and of how economics rescued mankind from squalor and deprivation by placing its material fate in its own hands rather than in Fate. ,Nasarâ€™s account begins with Charles Dickens and Henry Mayhew observing and publishing the condition of the poor majority in mid-nineteenth-century London, the richest and most glittering place in the world. This was a new pursuit. She describes the often heroic efforts of Marx, Engels, Alfred Marshall, Beatrice and Sydney Webb, and the American Irving Fisher to put those insights into actionâ€”with revolutionary consequences for the world. ,From the great John Maynard Keynes to Schumpeter, Hayek, Keynesâ€™s disciple Joan Robinson, the influential American economists Paul Samuelson and Milton Freedman, and Indiaâ€™s Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen, she shows how the insights of these activist thinkers transformed the worldâ€”from one city, London, to the developed nations in Europe and America, and now to the entire planet. In Nasarâ€™s dramatic narrative of these discoverers we witness men and women responding to personal crises, world wars, revolutions, economic upheavals, and each otherâ€™s ideas to turn back Malthus and transform the dismal science into a triumph over mankindâ€™s hitherto age-old destiny of misery and early death. This idea, unimaginable less than 200 years ago, is a story of trial and error, but ultimately transcendent, as it is rendered here in a stunning and moving narrative.","Economics,History,Nonfiction,Biography,Business,Politics,Social Science,Philosophy,Economics,Finance,History,World History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312155087l/10112793.jpg,684872986,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10112793-grand-pursuit,576,Grand Pursuit: A History of Economic Genius,112

John N. Gray,Hardcover,"At the heart of human experience lies an obsession with the nature of death. Religion, for most of history, has provided an explanation for human life and a vision of what comes after it. But in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such beliefs came under relentless pressure as new ideasâ€”from psychiatry to evolution to communismâ€”seemed to suggest that our fate was now in our own hands: humans could cease to be animals, defeat death, and become immortal.,In ,The Immortalization Commission,, theÂ acclaimed political philosopher and critic John Gray takes a brilliant and frightening look at humankindâ€™s dangerous striving toward a scientific version of immortality. Probing the parallel faiths of Bolshevik â€œGod-builders,â€ who sought to reshape the planet and psychical researchers, who believed they had evidence of a nonreligious form of life after death, Gray raises fascinating questions about how such beliefs threaten the very nature of what it means to be human. He looks to philosophers, journalists, politicians, charlatans, and mass murderers who all felt driven by a specifically scientific and modern worldview and whose revolt against death resulted in a series of experiments that ravaged whole countries. ,An urgent examination ofÂ Darwinâ€™s post-religious legacy,, The Immortalization Commission ,is an important work from â€œone of Britainâ€™s leading public intellectualsâ€ (,The Wall Street Journal,).","Philosophy,History,Science,Nonfiction,Religion,Death,Politics,Cultural",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393559492l/10116049.jpg,374175063,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10116049-the-immortalization-commission,288,The Immortalization Commission: Science and the Strange Quest to Cheat Death,137

Jess Faraday,Paperback,"London, 1889. For Ira Adler, former rent-boy and present plaything of crime lord Cain Goddard, stealing back the statue from Goddard's blackmailer should have been a doddle. But inside the statue is evidence that could put Goddard away for a long time under the sodomy laws, and everyone's after it, including Ira's bitter ex, Dr. Timothy Lazarus. No sooner does Ira have the porcelain dog in his hot little hands, than he loses it to a nimble-fingered prostitute.,As Iraâ€™s search for the dog drags him back to the mean East End streets where he grew up, he discovers secrets about his own past, and about Goddard's present business dealings, which make him question everything he thought he knew.

"Gotthold Ephraim Lessing,Veronica Richel",Paperback,"Mit dem 1755 erschienenen und uraufgefÃ¼hrten Drama ''Miss Sara Sampson'' schuf Gotthold Ephraim Lessing das erste bedeutende deutsche ""bÃ¼rgerliche Trauerspiel"", in dem nicht mehr die groÃŸen ""Haupt- und Staatsaktionen"", sondern Schicksale von Menschen aus dem ""Mittelstand"", aus BÃ¼rgertum und Landadel, behandelt werden.

Thom Jones,Paperback,"Thom Jones made his literary debut in The New Yorker in 1991. Within six months his stories appeared in Harper's, Esquire, Mirabella, Story, Buzz, and in The New Yorker twice more. ""The Pugilist at Rest"" - the title story from this stunning collection - took first place in Prize Stories 1993: The O. Henry Awards and was selected for inclusion in Best American Short Stories 1992. He is a writer of astonishing talent. Jones's stories - whether set in the combat zones of Vietnam or the brittle social and intellectual milieu of an elite New England college, whether recounting the poignant last battles of an alcoholic ex-fighter or the hallucinatory visions of an American wandering lost in Bombay in the aftermath of an epileptic fugue - are fueled by an almost brutal vision of the human condition, in a world without mercy or redemption. Physically battered, soul-sick, and morally exhausted, Jones's characters are yet unable to concede defeat: his stories are infused with the improbable grace of the spirit that ought to collapse, but cannot. For in these extraordinary pieces of fiction, it is not goodness that finally redeems us, but the heart's illogical resilience, and the ennobling tenacity with which we cling to each other and to our lives. The publication of The Pugilist at Rest is a major literary event, heralding the arrival of an electrifying new voice in American fiction, and a writer of magnificent depth and range. With these eleven stories, Thom Jones takes his place among the ranks of this country's most important authors.","Short Stories,Fiction,Literature,War,Literature,American,Literary Fiction,Literature,20th Century,Novels,The United States Of America,Short Stories,Short Story Collection",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388183917l/101172.jpg,316473049,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101172.The_Pugilist_at_Rest,240,The Pugilist at Rest,73

"Naoyuki Ii,Wayne P. Lammers",Paperback,"Businessman Yuki Yajima is fifty-one years old. He and his wife, Asako, are the parents of two daughters: Ryo, seventeen, and Yuka, an infant of only two months. Asking himself why heâ€™s allowed himself to become a father again at his age, Yuki begins to remember his uncle, who died quite youngâ€”younger, ,indeed, than Yuki is now. Thinking of this man, whom the young Yuki idolized, and who first introduced the boy to authors like KenzaburÅ ÅŒe and the Marquis de Sade, serves as a strange tipping point: allowing a sense of chaos and complexity back into his otherwise well-heeled life. A rare work of fiction focused simply on a man of integrityâ€”a dying breed, in novelsâ€”,The Shadow of a Blue Cat, meticulously renders his life and opinions as Yuki tries to find a middle path between the radicalism of his uncleâ€™s life and the quiet bourgeois home heâ€™s worked so hard to build. ,From ,The Shadow of a Blue Cat,:,â€œ,Perhaps I should start with a disclaimer. I am not some fresh-faced kid of seventeen or twenty, or even a relatively green thirty, which some people actually argue should be considered below the age of majority these days. No, the fact is, Iâ€™ve already slid right on past the big five-ohâ€”a milestone no one thinks is very pretty and few are eager to reachâ€”to become a man of fifty-one. , Now if a reader were to say that itâ€™s unsettling to have someone whoâ€™s passed the half-century mark presenting himself as the narrator of a novel styled after the young writers of a generation ago, I would have to agree he has a point. But however much I may agree, I expect to press ahead in exactly such a style, for as I struggle to come to terms with my fifty-something self, it has become all too uncomfortably clear to me that a style more suited to a man my age simply does not exist.,â€","Cultural,Japan,Asian Literature,Japanese Literature,Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385447124l/10118668.jpg,1564786412,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10118668-shadow-of-a-blue-cat,272,Shadow of a Blue Cat,25
Nina Auerbach,Hardcover,"This collection of essays (written 1967-83) is of interest because it reveals the development of a feminist criticism and the growing assuranceand daringof an accomplished scholar.

Dabney",Hardcover,"Edmund Wilson was the dominant American literary critic from the 1920s until his death in 1972, but he was also far more than that: a chronicler of his times, a historian of ideas, a probing observer of himself and of the society around him. With this volume and a companion volume devoted to the 30s and 40s--the first two entries in what will be a series devoted to Wilson's work--The Library of America pays tribute to the writer who first conceived the idea of a publishing series dedicated to ""bringing out in a complete and compact form the principal American classics."" ""Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1930s and 40s"" gives us Wilson at the midpoint of his extraordinary career as critic and scholar, and includes in complete form three of his most significant books. ""The Triple Thinkers"" (1938, revised 1948) and ""The Wound and the Bow"" (1941) give us Wilson at the height of his powers, in a series of extended literary studies marked by his unique combination of criticism, biographical narrative, and psychological analysis. Here are his dazzling portraits of Pushkin and Flaubert, Dickens and Henry James, Kipling and Casanova, equally sensitive to historical context and his subjects' inner lives; his scintillating reader's guide to the mysteries of Finnegans Wake and his celebrated exploration of the nature of creativity through the figure of Sophocles' wounded hero Philoctetes. ""Classics and Commercials"" (1950) is Wilson's gathering of the best of his reviews from the 1940s, a collection that exemplifies the range and omnivorousness of his interests. In the exact and fluent prose that makes him an unfailing delight to read, Wilson takes on everything from Gogol and Tolstoy to contemporaries like James M. Cain, Katherine Anne Porter, Dorothy Parker, and William Faulkner. Whether registering his qualms about detective novels, parsing the etiquette manuals of Emily Post, or paying tribute to the comic genius of Evelyn Waugh, Wilson turns any critical occasion into the highest kind of pleasure. The volume is completed with a selection of uncollected reviews from this period, including Wilson's observations on the work of William Maxwell, Saul Bellow, and Anais Nin.","Writing,Essays,Criticism,Literary Criticism,Literature,American,Unfinished,Criticism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347255589l/1011886.jpg,1598530143,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1011886.Literary_Essays_and_Reviews_of_the_1930s_40s,1000,Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1930s & 40s,102

Budd Schulberg,Hardcover,"What Makes Sammy Run?,Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our timesâ€”from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run?,This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New Yorkâ€™s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristicâ€”his congenital incapacity for friendship.,An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.,When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glickâ€™s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.","Fiction,Classics,Novels,Culture,Film,Literature,American,Philosophy,Literature,Media Tie In,Contemporary,Self Help",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171476932l/101191.jpg,375508317,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101191.What_Makes_Sammy_Run_,320,What Makes Sammy Run?,114

Ben Westhoff,Paperback,"Rap music from New York and Los Angeles once ruled the charts, but nowadays the southern sound thoroughly dominates the radio, ,Billboard,, and MTV. Coastal artists like Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, and Ice-T call southern rap â€œgarbage,â€ but theyâ€™re probably just jealous, as artists like Lil Wayne and T.I. still move millions of copies, and OutKast has the bestselling rap album of all time.,In ,Dirty South,, author Ben Westhoff investigates the southern rap phenomenon, watching rappers â€œmake it rainâ€ in a Houston strip club and partying with the 2 Live Crewâ€™s Luke Campbell. Westhoff visits the gritty neighborhoods where T.I. and Lil Wayne grew up, kicks it with Big Boi in Atlanta, and speaks with artists like DJ Smurf and Ms. Peachez, dance-craze originators accused of setting back the black race fifty years. Acting both as investigative journalist and irreverent critic, Westhoff probes the celebrated-but-dark history of Houston label Rap-A-Lot Records, details the lethal rivalry between Atlanta MCs Gucci Mane and Young Jeezy, and gets venerable rapper Scarface to open up about his time in a mental institution. ,Dirty South, features exclusive interviews with the genreâ€™s most colorful players.,Westhoff has written a journalistic tour de force, the definitive account of the most vital musical culture of our time.","Music,Hip Hop,Music,Nonfiction,Culture,Pop Culture",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328752048l/10119693.jpg,1569766061,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10119693-dirty-south,240,"Dirty South: OutKast, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, and the Southern Rappers Who Reinvented Hip-Hop",39
"Alice H. Eagly,Linda L. Carli",Hardcover,"Despite real progress, women remain rare enough in elite positions of power that their presence still evokes a sense of wonder. In ,Through the Labyrinth,, Alice Eagly and Linda Carli examine why women's paths to power remain difficult to traverse. First, Eagly and Carli prove that the glass ceiling is no longer a useful metaphor and offer seven reasons why. They propose the labyrinth as a better image and explain how to navigate through it. This important and practical book addresses such critical questions as: How far have women actually come as leaders? Do stereotypes and prejudices still limit women's opportunities? Do people resist women's leadership more than men's? And, do organisations create obstacles to women who would be leaders?This book's rich analysis is founded on scientific research from psychology, economics, sociology, political science, and management. The authors ground their conclusions in that research and invoke a wealth of engaging anecdotes and personal accounts to illustrate the practical principles that emerge. With excellent leadership in short supply, no group, organisation, or nation can afford to restrict women's access to leadership roles. This book evaluates whether such restrictions are present and, when they are, what we can do to eliminate them.","Nonfiction,Business,Leadership,Feminism,Womens,Business,Management,Gender",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403405734l/1011979.jpg,1422116913,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1011979.Through_the_Labyrinth,320,Through the Labyrinth: The Truth About How Women Become Leaders,46

Scott DeVeaux,Paperback,"The richest place in America's musical landscape is that fertile ground occupied by jazz. Scott DeVeaux takes a central chapter in the history of jazzâ€”the birth of bebopâ€”and shows how our contemporary ideas of this uniquely American art form flow from that pivotal moment. At the same time, he provides an extraordinary view of the United States in the decades just prior to the civil rights movement., DeVeaux begins with an examination of the Swing Era, focusing particularly on the position of African American musicians. He highlights the role played by tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, a ""progressive"" committed to a vision in which black jazz musicians would find a place in the world commensurate with their skills. He then looks at the young musicians of the early 1940s, including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk, and links issues within the jazz world to other developments on the American scene, including the turmoil during World War II and the pervasive racism of the period., Throughout, DeVeaux places musicians within the context of their professional world, paying close attention to the challenges of making a living as well as of making good music. He shows that bebop was simultaneously an artistic movement, an ideological statement, and a commercial phenomenon., In drawing from the rich oral histories that a living tradition provides, DeVeaux's book resonates with the narratives of individual lives. While ,The Birth of Bebop, is a study in American cultural history and a critical musical inquiry, it is also a fitting homage to bebop and to those who made it possible.","Music,Music,Jazz,Nonfiction,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1341458018l/1012008.jpg,520216652,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1012008.The_Birth_Of_Bebop,587,The Birth Of Bebop: A Social And Musical History,32

Neil Lanctot,Hardcover,"Neil Lanctotâ€™s biography of Hall of Fame catcher Roy Campanellaâ€”filled with surprisesâ€”is the first life of the Dodger great in decades and the most authoritative ever published. Born to a father of Italian descent and an African- American mother, Campanella wanted to be a ballplayer from childhood but was barred by color from the major leagues. He dropped out of school to play professional ball with the Negro Leaguesâ€™ Washington (later Baltimore) Elite Giants, where he honed his skills under Hall of Fame catcher Biz Mackey. Campy played eight years in the Negro Leagues until the major leagues integrated. Ironically, he and not Jackie Robinson might have been the player to integrate baseball, as Lanctot reveals. An early recruit to Branch Rickeyâ€™s â€œGreat Experimentâ€ with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Campy became the first African-American catcher in the twentieth century in the major leagues. As Lanctot discloses, Campanella and Robinson, pioneers of integration, had a contentious relationship, largely as a result of a dispute over postseason barnstorming.,Campanella was a mainstay of the great Dodger teams that consistently contended for pennants in the late 1940s and 1950s. He was a three-time MVP, an outstanding defensive catcher, and a powerful offensive threat. But on a rainy January night in 1958, all that changed. On his way home from his liquor store in Harlem, Campy lost control of his car, hit a utility pole, and was paralyzed below the neck. Lanctot reveals how Campanellaâ€™s complicated personal life (he would marry three times) played a role in the accident. Campanella would now become another sort of pioneer, learning new techniques of physical therapy under the celebrated Dr. Howard Rusk at his Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. As he gradually recovered some limited motion, Campanella inspired other athletes and physically handicapped people everywhere.,Based on interviews with dozens of people who knew Roy Campanella and diligent research into contemporary sources, ,Campy ,offers a three-dimensional portrait of this gifted athlete and remarkable man whose second life after baseball would prove as illustrious and courageous as his first.","Sports,Baseball,Sports,Sports,Biography,History,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348625741l/10121429.jpg,1416547045,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10121429-campy,528,Campy: The Two Lives of Roy Campanella,59

This came only from those who had never been there, but they were the vast majority. The very few who had been mostly solid British traders sturdily denied this they said there was no people with whom it was easier for us to get on than the Russians. I decided to go and find out. Perhaps Russia was not our enemy, perhaps she might even be a friend. From the out set, to remain entirely free in my judgment, I determined to be rigorously non-party, and I have never yet even voted in a political election. With this in mind, I went first to the other great coun tries of Europe, lived among their peoples, learned their languages, sometimes studied in their universities. My special study of them ran from Voltaire to the present time, a period full of wars and revolutions. With this background I went on to Russia for a year in 1898 and did the same. After pondering for some years over what I had seen and heard, I came again in 1904, but this time with plan and purpose. I traveled in a cart in various provinces my special interest was the peasants. I was just in time for the Japanese War and the great liberal movement which swept Russia directly after it. ix To My American Friends In 1906 was summoned the first Russian parliament the Duma, which was practically elected by universal male suf frage. I attended its sittings, and here I went into partner ship with a young American, Samuel N. Harper, son of the famous builder of the University of Chicago a partnership which, though our views were not necessarily identical, was to last for life. We lived, traveled, and studied together in town and country, and from then on always kept in closest touch. Together we went to see those who were playing any important part. With Russians the direct Approach is the right one. They are friendly and love to talk, and as their confidences were kept, anyone would tell us what he was out for, what he had done, and why. For a long time we recorded every conversation, for our own use, before we went to bed. When this direct partnership was no longer possible, I was concerned with work of many kinds for Anglo-Russian friendship and the promotion of study in my own country. The variety of my experiences will come out in this book. I lived through the last war on the Russian front and saw the first years of the Revolution. During the break in Anglo-Russian relations, I was busy organizing Russian studies in the University of London, and I made two extensive visits to the United States to establish close cooperation with colleagues here, speaking at many universities. I have since made four visits to the Soviet Unionthe last on the eve of the present war. In 1943 I lectured through Canada and the United States and I am now, for the second time, teaching in . an American university. In writing this book I To My American Friends have been greatly indebted to my colleagues here...","History,Russian History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1419182458l/10121777.jpg,1406768073,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10121777-russia-and-the-peace,308,Russia and the Peace,61

John Carey,Paperback,"In this landmark study, John Carey analyzes the elitest views of some of the most highly respected literary icons of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This book, as defined in his preface, ""is about the response of the English literary intelligentsia to the new phenomenon of mass culture."" Readers may be shocked to learn that H.G. Wells liked to think that this newly emerged ""mass"" would be eliminated by plague and atomic bombs; that Yeats wished them to perish in an apocalyptic war against the educated classes and that D.H. Lawrence visualized a huge lethal chamber in which they could be exterminated.,John Carey's devastating attack on the intellectuals exposes the loathing which the mass of humanity ignited in many of the virtual founders of modern culture: G.B. Shaw, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot and others. Professor Carey compares their detestation of common humanity to Nietzsche, whose philosophy helped create the atmosphere leading to the rise of Adolph Hitler. Any student of modern literature and history will find John Carey's incisive book both enlightening and disturbing, an essential read for a full understanding of where we are today.","Nonfiction,History,Politics,Philosophy,Criticism,Literary Criticism,Criticism,Literature,Cultural,Culture,Cultural Studies,Sociology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1396834444l/101229.jpg,897335074,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101229.The_Intellectuals_and_The_Masses,246,"The Intellectuals and The Masses: Pride and Prejudice Among the Literary Intelligentsia, 1880 - 1939",50
David Attenborough,Hardcover,"David Attenborough first established his current reputation on television with his Zoo Quest series, and these original accounts of his travels proved him to be an excellent writer and a gifted and amusing story teller. This edition brings together, slightly abridged, his descriptions of three journeys - to Guyana where he explored the broad savannahs of the Rupununi, the creeks and swamps of the coast, and the remote forest reserve of the Amerindians; to Indonesia in search of the Komodo dragon; and to Paraguay to seek, among other animals, the elusive giant armadillo. The book abounds with superb vignettes of bizarre characters - Mistah King, the mermaid fisherman; the shanty singers Lord Lucifer and the Great Smasher; Comelli, the wandering jaguar hunter; and the fat, jolly Gertie who claimed she has a 'highly nervous psychological disposition'. The author also tells, disarmingly, of the hardships of the journey by launch and canoes up the rivers of South America, of his travel by horseback through the parched, inhospitable Chac of Paraguay, sometimes swamp and sometimes desert, and of a hazardous voyage by prau under the captaincy of a gun-smuggler. At all times the author shows his acute powers of observation, his irrepressible sense of the ridiculous, and his gift as a brilliant raconteur. No one has written more entertaining travel books, and this collected edition, superbly illustrated by photographs, will be hugely enjoyed for its evocative descriptions of animals, people and places.","Environment,Nature,Nonfiction,Animals,Science,Travel,Wildlife,Science,Natural History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1376879556l/1012305.jpg,718824652,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1012305.The_Zoo_Quest_Expeditions,388,The Zoo Quest Expeditions,92

David Archer,Paperback,"The Global Carbon Cycle, is a short introduction to this essential geochemical driver of the Earth's climate system, written by one of the world's leading climate-science experts. In this one-of-a-kind primer, David Archer engages readers in clear and simple terms about the many ways the global carbon cycle is woven into our climate system. He begins with a concise overview of the subject, and then looks at the carbon cycle on three different time scales, describing how the cycle interacts with climate in very distinct ways in each. On million-year time scales, feedbacks in the carbon cycle stabilize Earth's climate and oxygen concentrations. Archer explains how on hundred-thousand-year glacial/interglacial time scales, the carbon cycle in the ocean amplifies climate change, and how, on the human time scale of decades, the carbon cycle has been dampening climate change by absorbing fossil-fuel carbon dioxide into the oceans and land biosphere. A central question of the book is whether the carbon cycle could once again act to amplify climate change in centuries to come, for example through melting permafrost peatlands and methane hydrates., ,The Global Carbon Cycle, features a glossary of terms, suggestions for further reading, and explanations of equations, as well as a forward-looking discussion of open questions about the global carbon cycle.","Science,Planetary Science,Nonfiction,Environment,Climate Change",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348118180l/10123345.jpg,691144141,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10123345-the-global-carbon-cycle,205,The Global Carbon Cycle,116

Andrew G. Bostom,Hardcover,"This comprehensive, meticulously documented collection of scholarly articles presents indisputable evidence that a readily discernible, uniquely Islamic antisemitism-a specific Muslim hatred of Jews-has been expressed continuously since the advent of Islam. Debunking the conventional wisdom, which continues to assert that Muslim animosity toward Jews is entirely a 20th-century phenomenon fueled mainly by the protracted Arab-Israeli conflict, leading scholars provide example after example of antisemitic motifs in Muslim documents reaching back to the beginnings of Islam. The contributors show that the Koran itself is a significant source of hostility toward Jews, as well as other foundational Muslim texts including the hadith (the words and deeds of Muhammad as recorded by pious Muslim transmitters) and the sira (the earliest Muslim biographies of Muhammad). Many other examples are adduced in the writings of influential Muslim jurists, theologians, and scholars, from the Middle Ages through the contemporary era. These primary sources, and seminal secondary analyses translated here for the first time into English - such as Hartwig Hirschfeld's mid-1880s essays on Muhammad's subjugation of the Jews of Medina and George Vajda's elegant, comprehensive 1937 study of the hadith - detail the sacralized rationale for Islam's anti-Jewish bigotry. Numerous complementary historical accounts illustrate the resulting plight of Jewish communities in the Muslim world across space and time, culminating in the genocidal threat posed to the Jews of Israel today.","Religion,Islam,Nonfiction,History,Cultural,Israel,Religion,Religion,Judaism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365463605l/1012402.jpg,1591025540,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1012402.The_Legacy_of_Islamic_Antisemitism,766,The Legacy of Islamic Antisemitism: From Sacred Texts to Solemn History,64

Tiqqun,Paperback,"An urgent critique of the biopolitical subject and omnipresent Empire.,Historical conflict no longer opposes two massive molar heaps, two classesâ€”the exploited and the exploiters, the dominant and dominated, managers and workers - between which, in each individual case, it would be possible to differentiate. The front line no longer cuts through the middle of society; it now runs through each one of us... â€œ â€” from This Is Not a Program,Traditional lines of revolutionary struggle no longer hold. Rather, it is ubiquitous cybernetics, surveillance, and terror that create the illusion of difference within hegemony. Configurations of dissent and the rhetoric of revolution are merely the other face of capital, conforming identities to empty predicates, ensuring that even â€œthieves,â€ â€œsaboteurs,â€ and â€œterroristsâ€ no longer exceed the totalizing space of Empire. This Is Not a Program offers two texts, both originally published in French by Tiqqun with Introduction to Civil War in 2001. In This Is Not a Program, Tiqqun outlines a new path for resistance and struggle in the age of Empire, one that eschews the worn-out example of France's May '68 in favor of what they consider to be the still fruitful and contemporary insurrectionary movements in Italy of the 1970s. â€œAs a Science of Apparatusesâ€ examines the way Empire has enforced on the subject a veritable metaphysics of isolation and pacification, â€œapparatusesâ€ that include chairs, desks, computers; surveillance (security guards, cameras); disease (depression); crutch (cell phone, lover, sedative); and authority. Tiqqun's critique of the biopolitical subject and omnipresent Empire is all the more urgent as we become inured to the permanent state of exception that is the War on Terror and to other, no less intimate forms of pacification. But all is not lost. In its unrelenting production of the Same, Empire itself creates the conditions necessary for the insurrection to come.","Philosophy,Philosophy,Theory,Politics,Nonfiction,European Literature,French Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347452509l/10124350.jpg,1584350970,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10124350-this-is-not-a-program,215,This is Not a Program,143

Paul W. Glimcher,Hardcover,"A new academic field, neuroeconomics, has emerged at the border of the social and natural sciences. In ,Foundations of Neuroeconomic Analysis, , Paul Glimcher argues that a meaningful interdisciplinary synthesis of the study of human and animal choice is not only desirable, but also well underway, and so it is time to formally develop a foundational approach for the field. He does so by laying the philosophical and empirical groundwork and integrating the theory of choice and valuation with the relevant physical constraints and mechanisms.,While there has been an intense debate about the value and prospects of neuroeconomics, Glimcher argues that existing data from neuroeconomics' three parent fields, neuroscience, psychology and economics, already specify the basic features of the primate choice mechanism at all three levels of analysis. His central argument is that combining these three disciplines gives us enough insight to define many of the fundamental features of decision making that have previously eluded scholars working within each individual field.,With this in mind, Glimcher provides a comprehensive overview of the neuroscience, psychology, and economics of choice behavior, which will help readers from many disciplines to grasp the rich interconnections between these fields and see how their data and theory can interact to produce new insights, constraints, and questions. The book is divided into four main sections that address key barriers to interdisciplinary cohesion. The first section defines the central philosophical issues that neuroeconomics must engage. The theory of knowledge already tells us much about how different disciplines interact, and in this section, Glimcher reviews those constraints and lays a philosophical foundation for future neuroeconomic discourse. This section concludes with both a defense of neoclassical economics and a spirited attack on Milton Friedman's insistence that economics must not be constrained by the study of mechanism. Glimcher argues instead for the development of hard-economic theories, which postulate that choosers behave the way they do because of the underlying representations that occur in their brains.,The second section describes what is known about the primate choice mechanism-the physical structures in our brains that actively select among the options available to the chooser. By reviewing and integrating economic theory of choice, neurobiological studies of the frontal and parietal cortices, and psychological models of selection, Glimcher creates an interdisciplinary structure for understanding how we choose. This interdisciplinary synthesis leads to several novel insights into the causes of human irrational behavior and recasts many of these so-called irrationalities as neurobiological optimizations in the face of physical constraints.,The third section describes the neural circuits for valuation-the physical mechanisms by which we learn, store, and represent the values of the many options from which we choose. In this section, Glimcher combines studies from computer science and neuroscience with representational frameworks from economics to provide novel assessments of both the strengths and weaknesses of modern economic theory. The section ends with a discussion of behavioral neuroeconomics and the ultimate limits of the neoclassical economic program.,The book concludes with a description of a new model for human choice behavior that harvests constraints from each of neuroeconomics' parent disciplines and encapsulates the key insights from current research, as well as a review of the major accomplishments and opportunities that await the new field of neuroeconomics.","Economics,Biology,Neuroscience,Psychology,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348134717l/10124703.jpg,199744254,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10124703-foundations-of-neuroeconomic-analysis,467,Foundations of Neuroeconomic Analysis,93

Conspiracy theories abound, not only in extremist ideologies and groups, but in commerce, science, and economics-arenas where a paranoid style is least expected. A curiosity about paranoia at its most reasonable is at the root of this volume.,Some pieces develop conversations that reveal the post-Cold War situations of countries such as Italy, Russia, Slovenia, and the United States where conspiratorial explanations of national dramas seem to make sense. Other pieces tackle paranoia as a style of debate in such diverse realms as science, psychotherapy, and popular entertainment, where conspiracy theories emerge as a compelling way to address the inadequacies of rational expertise and organization in the face of immense changes that undermine them.

If you're a newcomer to the subject, you'll learn valuable facts as the author guides you through the mine field of theories, counter-theories, and assumptions about Bigfoot. Knowledgeable researchers will find a treasure trove of little-known evidence and usually taboo concepts. In perfect detail, Shiel lays out her singular and astonishing revelations about Bigfoot, gleaned from years of research - both in the field and in the historical archives. Joining her odyssey, you'll explore: * Stick signs -purposeful symbols created with sticks and other material; * Mane braiding, where intricate braids appear in horses' manes overnight; * Predominant Bigfoot theories, and why they don't fit the facts; * UFO-Bigfoot connection details typically dismissed by academic pedagogues; and * Distorted human history and how it affects our perceptions of the Bigfoot enigma. From human evolution to lost civilizations, from UFOs to ancient artwork, Shiel weaves disparate threads into one incredible yet thoroughly believable theoretical tapestry - and leaves you breathless.","Folklore,Monsters",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348338093l/1012559.jpg,974655368,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1012559.Backyard_Bigfoot,200,"Backyard Bigfoot: The True Story of Stick Signs, UFOs, & the Sasquatch",149

Frederick E. Hoxie,Paperback,"This history of the Crow Indians links their nineteenth-century nomadic life and their modern existence. The Crows not only withstood the dislocation and conquest visited on them after 1805, but acted in the midst of these events to construct a modern Indian community--a nation. Their efforts sustained the pride and strength reflected in Chief Plenty Coups' statement in 1925 that he did ""not care at all what historians have to say about Crow Indians,"" as well as their community's faith in the beauty of its traditions and its inventions. Frederick E. Hoxie demonstrates that contact with outsiders drew the Crows together and tested their ability to adapt their traditions to new conditions.

R. Kent Hughes,Hardcover,"While each of the Gospels presents Christ with a distinct emphasis, the Gospel of John focuses on His greatness. As the timeless Creator-God of the universe. As the Word made flesh. As the gracious Lover of our souls who is the only Way to the Father. Instead of detailing the facts and events of His earthly life, as the other Gospel writers did, John concentrates on the meaning of Jesus' words and the message of His works, clearly presenting Him as the long-awaited Messiah with one mission in mind--to do the work of the Father who sent Him. The apostle's tremendous vision of Christ has, time and time again, opened the eyes of unbelievers to who Jesus is and to His singular role in our redemption. But its effect on Christians is equally profound, because in John's account the serious reader finds an ongoing, expanding view of the Savior's greatness and the wondrous meaning of His ministry. A view that widens and deepens with each return to this Gospel. Follow along with Pastor Kent Hughes in this engaging, verse-by-verse commentary as he leads you through this magnificent Gospel. His careful exposition and wise application will guide you to a richer understanding of not only God's greatness, but of His great goodness to us all. Recommendations for the Series It is a pleasure to commend the Crossway Books series of homiletical commentaries authored by Kent Hughes. They fill an enormous vacuum that exists between the practical needs of the pastor/teacher and the critical exegetical depth of most commentaries. With this series, evangelicalism may now claim its own William Barclay. While remaining true to the text and its original meaning, Dr. Hughes helps us face the personal, ethical, theological, and practical questions that the text wants us to answer in the presence of the living God and his illuminating Holy Spirit. --Dr. Walter C. Kaiser, Jr., Academic Dean, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School The Preaching the Word series is scholars' gold in preacher's grasp, obviously forged in the realities of daily ministry by a minister whose heart burns to make God's Word the guiding light and love of God's people. --Bryan Chapell, President, Covenant Theological Seminary The single best resource for faithful biblical exposition available today. A great boon for genuine reformation! --Timothy George, Dean, Samford University, Beeson Divinity School This series will minister to a pastor's soul as well as give him an immense resource for his preaching. And it will minister to the parishioner wonderfully in personal Bible study. The reader will be filled with fresh thoughts about our Lord as well as joyful encouragement for himself. That is what happened to me in reading this. --Dr. Kenneth N. Taylor, Translator, The Living Bible There is a long history of informed, edifying biblical expositions that have been mightily used of God to shape and strengthen the church. The volumes of Kent Hughes admirably fit into this tradition. --D. A. Carson, Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School Throughout the Christian centuries, from Chrysostom and Augustine through Luther, Calvin, and Matthew Henry, to Martyn Lloyd-Jones and Ray Stedman, working pastors have been proving themselves to be the best of all Bible expositors.

Patricia Nelson Limerick,Paperback,"The 'settling' of the American West has been perceived throughout the world as a series of quaint, violent, and romantic adventuresâ€“most with happy endingsâ€“and a process that came to an end with the 'closing' of the frontier in the 1890s. ,But in fact, Patricia Nelson Limerick argues, the West has a history grounded in primary economic reality; in hardheaded questions of profit, loss, competition, and consolidation. In ,The Legacy of Conquest,, she interprets the stories and the characters in a new way: the trappers, traders, Indians, farmers, oilmen, cowboys, and sheriffs of the Old West ""meant business"" in more ways than one, and their descendents mean business today.,"",Written with extraordinary grace and understandingâ€¦[this book] returns the Western American past to the mainstream of national history. â€¦Most important of all is her eloquent plea for Westerners, whether Anglo, Hispanic, Indian, Asian, or black, to see the West as a shared place, a splendid whole which each has helped create,."", -- Howard R.

Thomas S. Shores,Hardcover,"This book is about matrix and linear algebra, and their applications. For many students the tools of matrix and linear algebra will be as fundamental in their professional work as the tools of calculus; thus it is important to ensure that students appreciate the utility and beauty of these subjects as well as the mechanics. To this end, applied mathematics and mathematical modeling ought to have an important role in an introductory treatment of linear algebra. In this way students see that concepts of matrix and linear algebra make concrete problems workable. In this book we weave signi?cant motivating examples into the fabric of the text. I hope that instructors will not omit this material; that would be a missed opportunity for linear algebra! The text has a strong orientation toward numerical computation and applied mathematics, which means that matrix analysis plays a central role. All three of the basic components of l- ear algebra -- theory, computation, and applications -- receive their due. The proper balance of these components gives students the tools they need as well as the motivation to acquire these tools. Another feature of this text is an emphasis on linear algebra as an experimental science; this emphasis is found in certain examples, computer exercises, and projects. Contemporary mathematical software make ideal ""labs"" for mathematical experimentation. Nonetheless, this text is independent of speci?c hardware and software pl- forms. Applications and ideas should take center stage, not software.","Science,Mathematics,Mathematics,Algebra",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347644362l/10126941.jpg,387331948,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10126941-applied-linear-algebra-and-matrix-analysis,383,Applied Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis,78

Kristin Neff,Hardcover,"From leading psychologist Dr. Kristin Neff comes a step-by-step guide explaining how to be more self-compassionate and achieve your dreams in life,The relentless pursuit of high self-esteem has become a virtual religionâ€”and a tyrannical one at that. Our ultracompetitive culture tells us we need to be constantly ,above average, to feel good about ourselves, but there is always someone more attractive, successful, or intelligent than we are. And even when we ,do, manage to grab hold of high self-esteem for a brief moment, we can't seem to keep it. Our sense of self-worth goes up and down like a ping-pong ball, rising and falling in lockstep with our latest success or failure.,Fortunately, there is an alternative to self-esteem that many experts believe is a better and more effective path to happiness: self-compassion. The research of Dr. Kristin Neff and other leading psychologists indicates that people who are compassionate toward their failings and imperfections experience greater well-being than those who repeatedly judge themselves. The feelings of security and self-worth provided by self-compassion are also highly stable, kicking in precisely when self-esteem falls down. This book powerfully demonstrates why it's so important to be self-compassionate and give yourself the same caring support you'd give to a good friend.,This groundbreaking work will show you how to let go of debilitating self-criticism and finally learn to be kind to yourself. Using solid empirical research, personal stories, practical exercises, and humor, Dr. Neffâ€”the world's foremost expert on self-compassionâ€”explains how to heal destructive emotional patterns so that you can be healthier, happier, and more effective. Engaging, highly readable, and eminently accessible, this book has the power to change your life.","Self Help,Psychology,Nonfiction,Health,Mental Health,Self Help,Personal Development,Health,Spirituality,Audiobook,Psychology,Counselling,Philosophy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1482866880l/10127008._SY475_.jpg,61733512,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10127008-self-compassion,320,Self-Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself,7
Eric Ries,Hardcover,"Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. ,Eric Ries defines a startup as ,an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty,. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.,The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on ""validated learning,"" rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.,Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, ,The Lean Startup, offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late.

Mary V. Dearborn,Hardcover,"Peggy Guggenheim emerges in Mistress of Modernism as the ultimate self-invented woman, a cultural mover and shaker who broke away from her poor-little-rich-girl origins to shape a life for herself as the enfant terrible of the art world. Peggy's visionary Art of This Century gallery in New York, which brought together the European surrealist artists with the American abstract expressionists, was an epoch-shaking ""happening"" at the center of its time., Dearborn's unprecedented access to the Guggenheim family, friends, and papers contributes rich insight to Peggy's traumatic childhood in German-Jewish ""Our Crowd"" New York, her self-education in the ways of art and artists, her caustic battles with other art-collecting Guggenheims, and her legendary sexual appetites: her lovers included Max Ernst, Samuel Beckett, and Marcel Duchamp, to name a mere few.

Mark Gregory Pegg,Paperback,"On two hundred and one days between May 1, 1245, and August 1, 1246, more than five thousand people from the Lauragais were questioned in Toulouse about the heresy of the good men and the good women (more commonly known as Catharism). Nobles and diviners, butchers and monks, concubines and physicians, blacksmiths and pregnant girls--in short, all men over fourteen and women over twelve--were summoned by Dominican inquisitors Bernart de Caux and Jean de Saint-Pierre. In the cloister of the Saint-Sernin abbey, before scribes and witnesses, they confessed whether they, or anyone else, had ever seen, heard, helped, or sought salvation through the heretics. This inquisition into heretical depravity was the single largest investigation, in the shortest time, in the entire European Middle Ages.,Mark Gregory Pegg examines the sole surviving manuscript of this great inquisition with unprecedented care--often in unexpected ways--to build a richly textured understanding of social life in southern France in the early thirteenth century. He explores what the interrogations reveal about the individual and communal lives of those interrogated and how the interrogations themselves shaped villagers' perceptions of those lives. ,The Corruption of Angels,, similar in breadth and scope to Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's ,Montaillou,, is a major contribution to the field. It shows how heretical and orthodox beliefs flourished side by side and, more broadly, what life was like in one particular time and place. Pegg's passionate and beautifully written evocation of a medieval world will fascinate a diverse readership within and beyond the academy.","History,History,Medieval History,History,European History,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348044496l/1012747.jpg,691123713,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1012747.The_Corruption_of_Angels,238,The Corruption of Angels: The Great Inquisition of 1245-1246,104
Mark Gregory Pegg,Hardcover,"In January of 1208, a papal legate was murdered on the banks of the Rhone in southern France. A furious Pope Innocent III accused heretics of the crime and called upon all Christians to exterminate heresy between the Garonne and Rhone rivers--a vast region now known as Languedoc--in a great crusade. This most holy war, the first in which Christians were promised salvation for killing other Christians, lasted twenty bloody years--it was a long savage battle for the soul of Christendom., In ,A Most Holy War,, historian Mark Pegg has produced a swift-moving, gripping narrative of this horrific crusade, drawing in part on thousands of testimonies collected by inquisitors in the years 1235 to 1245. These accounts of ordinary men and women, remembering what it was like to live through such brutal times, bring the story vividly to life. Pegg argues that generations of historians (and novelists) have misunderstood the crusade; they assumed it was a war against the Cathars, the most famous heretics of the Middle Ages. The Cathars, Pegg reveals, never existed. He further shows how a millennial fervor about cleansing the world of heresy, coupled with a fear that Christendom was being eaten away from within by heretics who looked no different than other Christians, made the battles, sieges, and massacres of the crusade almost apocalyptic in their cruel intensity. In responding to this fear with a holy genocidal war, Innocent III fundamentally changed how Western civilization dealt with individuals accused of corrupting society. This fundamental change, Pegg argues, led directly to the creation of the inquisition, the rise of an anti-Semitism dedicated to the violent elimination of Jews, and even the holy violence of the Reconquista in Spain and in the New World in the fifteenth century. All derive their divinely sanctioned slaughter from the Albigensian Crusade., Haunting and immersive, ,A Most Holy War, opens an important new perspective on a truly pivotal moment in world history, a first and distant foreshadowing of the genocide and holy violence in the modern world.","History,Nonfiction,Historical,Medieval,Religion,History,European History,Military,Military History,Cultural,France",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266695735l/1012748.jpg,195171314,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1012748.A_Most_Holy_War,253,A Most Holy War: The Albigensian Crusade and the Battle for Christendom,116
Duke Ellington,Paperback,"â€Music is my mistress, and she plays second fiddle to no one.â€ This is the story of Duke Ellingtonâ€”the story of Jazz itself. Told in his own way, in his own words, a symphony written by the King of Jazz. His story spans and defines a half-century of modern music.This man who created over 1500 compositions was as much at home in Harlem's Cotton Club in the â€˜20s as he was at a White House birthday celebration in his honor in the â€˜60s. For Duke knew everyone and savored them all. Passionate about his music and the people who made music, he counted as his friends hundreds of the musicians who changed the face of music throughout the world: Bechet, Basie, Armstrong, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Sinatra, to name a few of them. Here are 100 photographs to give us an intimate view of Duke's worldâ€”his family, his friends, his associates.What emerges most strongly in his commitment to music, the mistress for whom he saves the fullest intensity of his passion. â€Lovers have come and gone, but only my mistress stays,â€ he says. He composed not only songs that all the world has sung, but also suites, sacred works, music for stage and screen and symphonies. This rich book, the embodiment of the life and works of the Duke, is replete with appendices listing singers, arrangers, lyricists and the symphony orchestras with whom the Duke played. There is a book to own and cherish by all who love Jazz and the contributions made to it by the Duke.","Music,Biography,Music,Jazz,Nonfiction,Autobiography,Memoir,Biography,Autobiography,Art,Biography Memoir,Music,Musicians,Literature,American",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327990355l/101274.jpg,306800330,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101274.Music_is_My_Mistress,544,Music is My Mistress,38

"Henrik Stangerup,Anna Cambieri,Anthony Burgess",Paperback,"Copenaghen, una sera qualunque, un appartamento come tanti in un condominio come tanti: bonsai sul tavolino, finestra con vista su un albero morente. Un uomo, dopo una lite violenta, uccide sua moglie. Una storia come tante. Ma lâ€™azione si svolge in un prossimo futuro, appena posteriore al nostro, e in una societÃ  che molto somiglia allâ€™ideale modello della socialdemocrazia scandinava, deformata quel che basta a renderla piÃ¹ universale. Inquietante realizzazione di unâ€™utopia, con lâ€™amara constatazione che â€œogni passo nella direzione giusta ne determina sempre troppi in quella sbagliataâ€. Il mitico stato che si prende cura del â€œbene comune dalla culla alla tombaâ€, si Ã¨ trasformato in una gabbia di conformismo, regno del consenso e dellâ€™eufemismo, in cui tutto Ã¨ pianificato e obbligatorio, compresa la felicitÃ .

Solitari destinati a perdere in unâ€™impari lotta contro il loro tempo, malati di trascendenza, i personaggi di Stangerup, figli di Kierkegaard, preferiscono sempre e comunque prendere il rischio della loro veritÃ  e provare a essere â€œQuel singoloâ€ che il filosofo danese voleva scrivere sulla sua tomba.","Fiction,Science Fiction,Dystopia,Cultural,Denmark,Science Fiction,European Literature,Scandinavian Literature,European Literature,Danish,Science Fiction Fantasy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328953326l/10128868.jpg,887091013X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10128868-l-uomo-che-voleva-essere-colpevole,184,L'uomo che voleva essere colpevole,138

Jay Hambidge,Paperback,"Is design intuitive or is it consciously and methodically worked out? Are there basic rules governing design that, when learned, will facilitate the creative process? These questions have been asked by artists, art historians, and art critics throughout the ages.,Convinced that design was not purely instinctive, Jay Hambidge (1867â€“1924) spent much of his life searching for the technical bases of design. He found his answer in dynamic symmetry, one of the most provocative and stimulating theories in art history. Hambidge's study of Greek art convinced him that the secret of the beauty of Greek design was in the conscious use of dynamic symmetry â€” the law of natural design based upon the symmetry of growth in man and in plants. But Hambidge, who was not only a theoretician but also a practicing artist, did much more than analyze classical art and its principles of design: he worked out a series of root rectangles that the artist, using the simple mathematics supplied in this book, can easily follow and apply in his own work.,Originally published as a series of lessons in Hambidge's magazine, ,The Diagonal,, this engrossing book explains all the basic principles of dynamic symmetry. Part I sets forth the fundamental rectangles with their simple divisions based on the proportioning law found in nature; Part II explains compound rectangles, many of which were taken from or suggested by analysis of objects of Greek art. ,Whether read for its historical importance in art theory, for its illuminating insights into Greek art, or for its practical value to today's artists and commercial designers, ,The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry, has much to offer anyone who is interested in the principle of design.","Art,Art,Art Design,Nonfiction,Design,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328865483l/1012981.jpg,486217760,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1012981.The_Elements_of_Dynamic_Symmetry,176,The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry,93

"John Lockwood,Charles Lockwood",Hardcover,"On April 14, 1861, following the surrender of Fort Sumter, Washington was put into the condition of a siege, declared Abraham Lincoln. Located sixty miles south of the Mason-Dixon Line, the nation's capital was surrounded by the slave states of Maryland and Virginia. With no fortifications and only a handful of trained soldiers, Washington was an ideal target for the Confederacy. The South echoed with cries of On to Washington! and Jefferson Davis's wife sent out cards inviting her friends to a reception at the White House on May 1.,Lincoln issued an emergency proclamation on April 15, calling for 75,000 troops to suppress the rebellion and protect the capital. One question now transfixed the nation: whose forces would reach Washington first-Northern defenders or Southern attackers?,For 12 days, the city's fate hung in the balance. Washington was entirely isolated from the North-without trains, telegraph, or mail. Sandbags were stacked around major landmarks, and the unfinished Capitol was transformed into a barracks, with volunteer troops camping out in the House and Senate chambers. Meanwhile, Maryland secessionists blocked the passage of Union reinforcements trying to reach Washington, and a rumored force of 20,000 Confederate soldiers lay in wait just across the Potomac River.,Drawing on firsthand accounts, ,The Siege of Washington, tells this story from the perspective of leading officials, residents trapped inside the city, Confederates plotting to seize it, and Union troops racing to save it, capturing with brilliance and immediacy the precarious first days of the Civil War.","History,Military History,Civil War,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,American History,American Civil War,Military,Military History,War,American Civil War,Civil War Eastern Theater,Historical,War,Military Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349088419l/10129989.jpg,199759898,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10129989-the-siege-of-washington,298,The Siege of Washington: The Untold Story of the Twelve Days That Shook the Union,125

Jonathan Bate,Paperback,"As we enter a new millennium ruled by technology, will poetry still matter? ,The Song of the Earth, answers eloquently in the affirmative. A book about our growing alienation from nature, it is also a brilliant meditation on the capacity of the writer to bring us back to earth, our home.,In the first ecological reading of English literature, Jonathan Bate traces the distinctions among nature, culture, and environment and shows how their meanings have changed since their appearance in the literature of the eighteenth century. An intricate interweaving of climatic, topographical, and political elements poetically deployed, his book ranges from greenhouses in Jane Austen's novels to fruit bats in the poetry of Les Murray, by way of Thomas Hardy's woodlands, Dr. Frankenstein's Creature, John Clare's birds' nests, Wordsworth's rivers, Byron's bear, and an early nineteenth-century novel about an orangutan who stands for Parliament. Though grounded in the English Romantic tradition, the book also explores American, Central European, and Caribbean poets and engages theoretically with Rousseau, Adorno, Bachelard, and especially Heidegger.,The model for an innovative and sophisticated new ecopoetics, ,The Song of the Earth, is at once an essential history of environmental consciousness and an impassioned argument for the necessity of literature in a time of ecological crisis.","Nonfiction,Poetry,Criticism,Literary Criticism,Literature,Academic,Biology,Ecology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348804177l/1013036.jpg,674008189,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013036.The_Song_of_the_Earth,360,The Song of the Earth,52

Timothy Spurgin,Audiobook,"Artful reading - the way we read novels and short stories - is less about reading for specific information and more about reading to revel in the literary experience. Learning the skills and techniques of artful reading can improve your life in many ways, whether you're a fiction reader, an aspiring writer, a book club member, or a student.,And the best part: These skills are not difficult or unwieldy; rather, they are well within your reach.

While some of these nuts-and-bolts concepts may be familiar to you, Professor Spurgin examines them from multiple angles, revealing hidden meanings that can escape even experienced readers.,Practical tips and techniques will maximize your effectiveness as an artful reader. You'll see why holding an initial reading session will acquaint you with the author's writing style and the characters, making the book easy to return to even if you take a few days off.,You'll also discover the benefits of ""pre-reading"" - exploring a book's organization and structure - and how to constantly ask questions to become more deeply involved with the characters and their stories.,Throughout the course, a host of literary ""case studies"" will refine and elaborate on the concepts of artful reading.

Eric L. Santner,Hardcover,"In November 1893, Daniel Paul Schreber, recently named presiding judge of the Saxon Supreme Court, was on the verge of a psychotic breakdown and entered a Leipzig psychiatric clinic. He would spend the rest of the nineteenth century in mental institutions. Once released, he published his ,Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, (1903), a harrowing account of real and delusional persecution, political intrigue, and states of sexual ecstasy as God's private concubine. Freud's famous case study of Schreber elevated the ,Memoirs ,into the most important psychiatric textbook of paranoia. In light of Eric Santner's analysis, Schreber's text becomes legible as a sort of nerve bible of ,fin-de-siï¿½cle, preoccupations and obsessions, an archive of the very phantasms that would, after the traumas of war, revolution, and the end of empire, coalesce into the core elements of National Socialist ideology., The crucial theoretical notion that allows Santner to pass from the private domain of psychotic disturbances to the public domain of the ideological and political genesis of Nazism is the crisis of investiture. Schreber's breakdown was precipitated by a malfunction in the rites and procedures through which an individual is endowed with a new social status: his condition became acute just as he was named to a position of ultimate symbolic authority. The ,Memoirs, suggest that we cross the threshold of modernity into a pervasive atmosphere of crisis and uncertainty when acts of symbolic investiture no longer usefully transform the subject's self understanding. At such a juncture, the performative force of these rites of institution may assume the shape of a demonic persecutor, some other who threatens our borders and our treasures. Challenging other political readings of Schreber, Santner denies that Schreber's delusional system--his own private Germany--actually prefigured the totalitarian solution to this defining structural crisis of modernity. Instead, Santner shows how this tragic figure succeeded in avoiding the totalitarian temptation by way of his own series of perverse identifications, above all with women and Jews.","Nonfiction,Psychology,Psychoanalysis,Philosophy,Theory,Psychology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180233052l/1013090._SX318_.jpg,691026289,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013090.My_Own_Private_Germany,240,My Own Private Germany: Daniel Paul Schreber's Secret History of Modernity,28

David McCullough,Hardcover,"The Greater Journey is the enthralling, inspiring - and until now, untold - story of the adventurous American artists, writers, doctors, politicians, architects, and others of high aspiration who set off for Paris in the years between 1830 and 1900, ambitious to excel in their work.,After risking the hazardous journey across the Atlantic, these Americans embarked on a greater journey in the City of Light. Most had never left home, never experienced a different culture. None had any guarantee of success. That they achieved so much for themselves and their country profoundly altered American history. As David McCullough writes, ""Not all pioneers went west."" Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in America, was one of this intrepid band. Another was Charles Sumner, who enrolled at the Sorbonne because of a burning desire to know more about everything. There he saw black students with the same ambition he had, and when he returned home, he would become the most powerful, unyielding voice for abolition in the U.S. Senate, almost at the cost of his life. ,Two staunch friends, James Fenimore Cooper and Samuel F. B. Morse, worked unrelentingly every day in Paris, Cooper writing and Morse painting what would be his masterpiece. From something he saw in France, Morse would also bring home his momentous idea for the telegraph. ,Pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk from New Orleans launched his spectacular career performing in Paris at age 15. George P. A. Healy, who had almost no money and little education, took the gamble of a lifetime and with no prospects whatsoever in Paris became one of the most celebrated portrait painters of the day. His subjects included Abraham Lincoln. ,Medical student Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote home of his toil and the exhilaration in ""being at the center of things"" in what was then the medical capital of the world. From all they learned in Paris, Holmes and his fellow ""medicals"" were to exert lasting influence on the profession of medicine in the United States. ,Writers Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and Henry James were all ""discovering"" Paris, marveling at the treasures in the Louvre, or out with the Sunday throngs strolling the city's boulevards and gardens. ""At last I have come into a dreamland,"" wrote Harriet Beecher Stowe, seeking escape from the notoriety Uncle Tom's Cabin had brought her. Almost forgotten today, the heroic American ambassador Elihu Washburne bravely remained at his post through the Franco-Prussian War, the long Siege of Paris and even more atrocious nightmare of the Commune. His vivid account in his diary of the starvation and suffering endured by the people of Paris (drawn on here for the first time) is one readers will never forget. The genius of sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the son of an immigrant shoemaker, and of painters Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent, three of the greatest American artists ever, would flourish in Paris, inspired by the examples of brilliant French masters, and by Paris itself. ,Nearly all of these Americans, whatever their troubles learning French, their spells of homesickness, and their suffering in the raw cold winters by the Seine, spent many of the happiest days and nights of their lives in Paris. McCullough tells this sweeping, fascinating story with power and intimacy, bringing us into the lives of remarkable men and women who, in Saint-Gaudens's phrase, longed ""to soar into the blue.""

Theo Pauline Nestor,Hardcover,"â€œI feel like Iâ€™ve joined an enormous club, something like the Veterans of Foreign Wars. We are weary with battle fatigue and sometimes even gripped by nostalgia for the good old, bad old days, but our numbers are large,â€ writes Theo Pauline Nestor in this wry, fiercely honest chronicle of life after divorce. ,Less than an hour after confronting her husband over his massive gambling losses, Theo banishes him from their home forever. With two young daughters to support and her life as a stay-at-home mother at an abrupt end, Nestor finds herself slipping from â€œmiddle-class graceâ€ as she attends a court-ordered custody class, stumbles through job interviews, andâ€“much to her surpriseâ€“falls in love once again. As Theo rebuilds her life and recovers her sense of self, sheâ€™s forced to confront her own familyâ€™s legacy of divorce. â€œIâ€™m from a long line of stock market speculators, artists of unmarketable talents, and alcoholics,â€ writes Nestor. â€œThe higher, harder road is not our road. We move, we divorce, we drink, or we disappear.â€,Nestorâ€™s journey takes her deep into her familyâ€™s past, to a tiny village in Mexico, where she discovers the truth about how her sister ended up living in a convent there after their parents divorced in the early sixties. What she learns ultimately brings her closer to understanding her own divorce and its impact on her two daughters. â€œI knew from experience that for children divorce means half the world is constantly eclipsed. When youâ€™re with one parent, the other must always slip out of view,â€ Nestor writes. ,Funny, openhearted, and brave, ,How to Sleep Alone in a King-Size Bed, will speak to anyone who has passed through the halls of divorce court or risked tenderness after loss.

Raymond Carr,Paperback,"In this up-to-date and engaging tour of Spain through the ages, one of the world's leading authorities on the history of Spain, Sir Raymond Carr, provides an authoritative overview of a country that has played a vital role in the history of the Western world.,He tells of prehistoric Spain and of the imposition of Roman rule, which created the idea of Hispania as a single entity. There are knowledgeable discussions of the Visigoth monarchy, Moorish Spain, the establishment of an empire, and the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Carr examines not only the political and economic development of Spain, but also the extraordinary artistic and literary achievements of the Spanish people. He charts the rise and fall of liberalism in the nineteenth century, and the subsequent period of political instability culminating in the Civil War and authoritarian rule. The book concludes with a look at modern Spain as a fully integrated and enthusiastic member of the European community.,Attractively illustrated throughout, ,Spain: A History, is the best historical account of Spain currently available for general readers.","History,Cultural,Spain,Nonfiction,History,European History,Travel,Reference",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347716785l/101324.jpg,192802364,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101324.Spain,335,Spain: A History,10
Peter GÃ¤rdenfors,Paperback,"Our ability to 'think' is really one of our most puzzling characteristics. What it would be like to be unable to think? What would it be like to lack self-awareness? The complexity of this activity is striking. 'Thinking' involves the interaction of a range of mental processes--attention, emotion, memory, planning, self-consciousness, free will, and language. So where did these processes arise? What evolutionary advantages were bestowed upon those with an ability to deceive, to plan, to empathize, or to understand the intention of others? In this compelling new work, Peter Gardenfors embarks on an evolutionary detective story to try and solve one of the big mysteries surrounding human existence--how has the modern human being's way of thinking come into existence. He starts by taking in turn the more basic cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, then builds upon these to explore more complex behaviors, such as self-consciousness, mindreading, and imitation. Having done this, he examines the consequences of putting thought into the world -i.e., using external media like cave paintings, drawings, and writing. Immensely readable and humorous, the book will be valuable for students in psychology and biology, and accessible to readers of popular science.","Biology,Evolution,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348871072l/1013259.jpg,198528515,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013259.How_Homo_Became_Sapiens,240,How Homo Became Sapiens: On the Evolution of Thinking,34
Alfred W. Crosby,Hardcover,"We don't often recognize the humble activity of cooking for the revolutionary cultural adaptation that it is. But when the hearth fires started burning in the Paleolithic, humankind broadened the exploitation of food and initiated an avalanche of change. And we don't often associate cooking with drilling for oil, but both are innovations that allow us to tap the sun energy accumulated in organic matter. Alfred W. Crosby, a founder of the field of global history, reveals how humanity's successes hinge directly on effective uses of sun energy. But dwindling natural resources, global warming, and environmental pollution all testify to the limits of our fossil-fuel civilization. Although we haven't yet adopted a feasible alternativeâ€”just look at the embarrassment of ""cold fusion"" or the 2003 blackout that humbled North Americaâ€”our ingenuity and adaptability as a species give us hope.","History,Nonfiction,Science,Science,Technology,Environment,Environment,Peak Oil",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349008159l/1013264.jpg,393059359,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013264.Children_of_the_Sun,208,Children of the Sun: A History of Humanity's Unappeasable Appetite for Energy,133
Robin Mather,Hardcover,"Within a single week in 2009, food journalist Robin Mather found herself on the threshold of a divorce and laid off from her job at the ,Chicago Tribune,. Forced into a radical life change, she returned to her native rural Michigan. ,Â ,There she learned to live on a limited budget while remaining true to her culinary principles of eating well and as locally as possible. In The Feast Nearby, Mather chronicles her year-long project: preparing and consuming three home-cooked, totally seasonal, and local meals a day--all on forty dollars a week. ,Â ,With insight and humor, Mather explores the confusion and needful compromises in eating locally. She examines why local often trumps organic, and wonders why the USDA recommends white bread, powdered milk, and instant orange drinks as part of its â€œlow-costâ€ food budget program. ,Â ,Through local eating, Mather forges connections with the farmers, vendors, and growers who provide her with sustenance. She becomes more closely attuned to the nuances of each season, inhabiting her little corner of the world more fully, and building a life richer than she imagined it could be. ,Â ,The Feast Nearby, celebrates small pleasures: home-roasted coffee, a pantry stocked with home-canned green beans and homemade preserves, and the contented clucking of laying hens in the backyard.

Richard Lloyd Dewey,Hardcover,"Read the true story of Brigham Young's bodyguard - a man history (and Hollywood) has completely overlooked - the only man to kill more outlaws than Wyatt Earp, Doc Holladay, Tom Horn, and Batt masterson . . . combined. A man who believed from a blessing he received from Joseph Smith that if he never cut his hair he could never die in a fight. Assassins ambushed him, but no one could kill him, as confirmed by the Deseret News in 1918, stating he had passed through dangers ""unscathed, as numerous as those recorded in the most lurid fiction"" after it had interviewed numerous settlers who had known him. Gunfighters traveled hundreds of miles to ""get him"" - none succeeded. Outlaws actually sang compfire ballads about him. Latter-day Saints are proud to view him as a folk hero. Reading this book allows us to see what a real hero is. Famed British journalist Jules Remy wrote in 1861, ""He is the stuff from which heroes are wrought. It is he who is ever at hand where there is a sacrifice to be made which can be of advantage to the oppressed."" Richard Lloyd Dewey quotes hundreds of original sources - journals, letters, and court records - some from sources never before tapped - and weaves them all together in fascinating form. In the process he clarifies the controversies, dispels the shadows, and melts away the myriads of anti-Mormon myths. Journalistic, fast-flowing writing sweeps you through explosive early Mormon history with charm and style. He reports little known events and unravels a bizarre yet faith-promoting tale. The Deseret News of 1986 reports, ""The writing is slick and the pace is fast. Dewey has done his homework."" It's a story told with breadth and feeling . . . the most intriguing, ACCURATE account yet of Orrin Porter Rockwell. Also the most comprehensive, by far. As the definitive work on him, this fascinating, epic biography is as exciting to read as a first-rate novel.

"Luciano Canfora,Martin Ryle",Paperback,"The Library of Alexandria, one of the wonders of the Ancient World, has haunted Western culture for over 2,000 years. The Ptolemaic kings of Egyptâ€”successors of Alexander the Greatâ€”had a staggering ambition: to house all of the books ever written under one roof, and the story of the universal library and its destruction still has the power to move us.,But what was the library, and where was it? Did it exist at all? Contemporary descriptions are vague and contradictory. The fate of the precious books themselves is a subject of endless speculation.,Canfora resolves these puzzles in one of the most unusual books of classical history ever written. He recreates the world of Egypt and the Greeks in brief chapters that marry the craft of the novelist and the discipline of the historian. Anecdotes, conversations, and reconstructions give ,The Vanished Library, the compulsion of an exotic tale, yet Canfora bases all of them on historical and literary sources, which he discusses with great panache.

Jonathan Lear,Paperback,"Separated by millennia, Aristotle and Sigmund Freud gave us disparate but compelling pictures of the human condition. But if, with ,Jonathan Lear,, we scrutinize these thinkers' attempts to explain human behavior in terms of a higher principle--whether happiness or death--the pictures fall apart. Aristotle attempted to ground ethical life in human striving for happiness, yet he didn't understand what happiness is any better than we do. Happiness became an enigmatic, always unattainable, means of seducing humankind into living an ethical life. Freud fared no better when he tried to ground human striving, aggression, and destructiveness in the death drive, like Aristotle attributing purpose where none exists. Neither overarching principle can guide or govern ""the remainder of life,"" in which our inherently disruptive unconscious moves in breaks and swerves to affect who and how we are. Lear exposes this tendency to self-disruption for what it is: an opening, an opportunity for new possibilities. His insights have profound consequences not only for analysis but for our understanding of civilization and its discontent.","Philosophy,Psychology,Psychoanalysis,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348579926l/101337.jpg,674006747,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101337.Happiness_Death_and_the_Remainder_of_Life,204,"Happiness, Death, and the Remainder of Life",18

He soon discovers that this â€œpromotionâ€ is a mixed blessing. The villagers are unwelcoming. He and his pregnant wife, Elena, have no place to live but the jail, and his own men seem strangely hostile. Is it just their suspicion of his wifeâ€™s Republican sympathies?

C.J. Box,Hardcover,"EdgarÂ® Award-winning and ,New York Times, bestselling author C.J. Box delivers a thriller about a troubled cop trying to save his son from a killer in Yellowstone.,Cody Hoyt, while a brilliant cop, is an alcoholic struggling with two months of sobriety when his mentor and AA sponsor Hank Winters is found burned to death in a remote mountain cabin. At first it looks like the suicide of a man who's fallen off the wagon, but Cody knows Hank better than that. Sober for fourteen years, Hank took pride in his hard-won sobriety and never hesitated to drop whatever he was doing to talk Cody off a ledge. When Cody takes a closer look at the scene of his friend's death, it becomes apparent that foul play is at hand. After years of bad behavior with his department, he's in no position to be investigating a homicide, but this man was a friend and Cody's determined to find his killer.,When clues found at the scene link the murderer to an outfitter leading tourists on a multi-day wilderness horseback trip into the remote corners of Yellowstone National Parkâ€”a pack trip that includes his son Justinâ€”Cody is desperate to get on their trail and stop the killer before the group heads into the wild.

"Steve Fainaru,Ray SÃ¡nchez",Hardcover,"In 1998, a mysterious right-handed pitcher emerged from the ashes of the Cold War and helped lead the New York Yankees to a World Championship. His origins and even his age were uncertain. His name was Orlando El Duque Hernandez. He was a fallen hero of Fidel Castro's socialist revolution.,The chronicle of El Duque's triumph is at once a window into the slow death of Cuban socialism and one of the most remarkable sports stories of all time. Once hailed as a paragon of Castro's revolution, the finest pitcher in modern Cuban history was banned from baseball for life for allegedly plotting to defect. Instead of accepting his punishment, he fearlessly fought back, defying the Communist party authorities, vowing to pitch again, and ultimately fleeing his country in the bowels of a thirty-foot fishing boat.,Here, for the first time and in astonishing detail, the secrets behind El Duque's persecution and escape are revealed. Moving from the crumbling streets of post Cold War Havana to the polarized world of exile Miami, from the deadly Florida Straits to the hallowed grounds of Yankee Stadium, it is a story of cloak-and-dagger adventure, audacious secret plots, the pull of big money, and the historic collision of ideologies.,Present throughout are the larger-than-life characters who converged at this bizarre intersection of baseball and politics: El Duque himself, Fidel Castro, the Miami sports agent Joe Cubas, the late John Cardinal O'Connor along with scouts, smugglers, and the Cuban ballplayers who gave up their lives as tools of socialism to test the free market and chase their major-league dreams.,Reported in the United States and Cuba by two award-winning journalists who became part of the story they were covering, The Duke of Havana is a riveting saga of sports, politics, liberation, and greed.,From the Hardcover edition.","Sports,Baseball,Sports,Sports,Biography,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328006770l/1013434.jpg,375503455,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013434.The_Duke_of_Havana,368,"The Duke of Havana: Baseball, Cuba, and the Search for the American Dream",71

One for each and every finger.,In ,Ten Rings,, Yogi, for the first time, tells the stories behind each of those remarkable championship seasons, spanning 1947 through 1962, baseball's golden years. It was a time when players played for the love of the game, a time when dynasties were born and baseball became the national pastime. And what a pastime it was.,With Yogi Berra at their heart, Casey Stengel's Yankees took on their heralded archrivals: the Cleveland Indians, the New York Giants, the Brooklyn Dodgers, and, of course, the Boston Red Sox. And with those teams was Yogi's constellation of contemporaries, a who's who of the Hall of Fame: Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Sandy Koufax, Willie Mays, Duke Snider, Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson, Phil Rizzuto, and many others.,Each season brought its own drama, and it's all brought to life by the man who witnessed it. ,Ten Rings, is a one-of-a-kind story told by a one-of-a-kind guy, baseball's elder statesman, the beloved Yogi Berra.","Sports,Baseball,Sports,Sports,Biography,Nonfiction,Biography,Autobiography,Autobiography,Memoir,North American Hi...,American History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349023500l/1013460.jpg,60749466,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013460.Ten_Rings,240,Ten Rings: My Championship Seasons,92

Paul J. Vanderwood,Paperback,"Paul J. Vanderwood offers a fascinating look at the events, beliefs, and circumstances that have motivated popular devotion to Juan Soldado, a Mexican folk saint. In his mortal incarnation, Juan Soldado was Juan Castillo Morales, a twenty-four-year-old soldier convicted of and quickly executed for the rape and murder of eight-year-old Olga Camacho in Tijuana in 1938. Immediately after Moralesâ€™s death, many people began to doubt the evidence of his guilt, or at least the justice of his brutal execution. People reported seeing blood seeping from his grave and hearing his soul cry out protesting his innocence. Soon the â€œmartyredâ€ Morales was known as Juan Soldado, or John the Soldier. Believing that those who have died unjustly sit closest to God, people began visiting Moralesâ€™s grave asking for favors. Within months of his death, the young soldier had become a popular saint. He is not recognized by the Catholic Church, yet thousands of people have made pilgrimages to his gravesite. While Juan Soldado is well known in Tijuana, southern Californiaâ€™s Mexican American community, and beyond, this book is the first to situate his story within a broader exploration of how and why popular canonizations such as his take root and flourish.In addition to conducting extensive archival research, Vanderwood interviewed central actors in the events of 1938, including Olga Camachoâ€™s mother, citizens who rioted to demand Moralesâ€™s release to a lynch mob, those who witnessed his execution, and some of the earliest believers in his miraculous powers. Vanderwood also interviewed many present-day visitors to the shrine at Moralesâ€™s grave. He describes them, their petitionsâ€”for favors such as health, a good marriage, or safe passage into the United Statesâ€”and how they reconcile their belief in Juan Soldado with their Catholicism. Vanderwood puts the events of 1938 within the context of Depression-era Tijuana and he locates peopleâ€™s devotion, then and now, within the history of extra-institutional religious activity. In ,Juan Soldado,, a gripping true-crime mystery opens up into a much larger and more elusive mystery of faith and belief.",History,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328864294l/1013548.jpg,822334151,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013548.Juan_Soldado,352,"Juan Soldado: Rapist, Murderer, Martyr, Saint",110

"Nancy Silverton,Matt Molina,Carolynn CarreÃ±o,Mario Batali",Hardcover,"A traditional Italian meal is one of the most comfortingâ€”and deliciousâ€”things that anyone can enjoy. Award-winning chef Nancy Silverton has elevated that experience to a whole new level at her Los Angeles restaurants Osteria Mozza and Pizzeria Mozza, co-owned with restaurateurs Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich. A reservation at Mozza has been the hottest ticket in town since the restaurants opened and diners have been lining up for their wildly popular dishes. Finally, in ,The Mozza Cookbook,, Silverton is sharing these recipes with the rest of the world.,The original idea for Mozza came to Nancy at her summer home in Panicale, Italy. And that authentic Italian feel is carried throughout the book as we explore recipes from ,aperitivo, to ,dolci, that she would serve at her ,tavola, at home. But do not confuse authentic with conventional! Under Silvertonâ€™s guidance, each bite is more exciting and delectable than the last, with recipes such as:,Fried Squash Blossoms with Ricotta,Buricotta with Braised Artichokes, Pine Nuts, Currants, and Mint Pesto ,Mussels ,al Forno, with Salsa Calabrese ,Fennel Sausage, Panna, and Scallion Pizza ,Fresh Ricotta and Egg Ravioli with Brown Butter ,Grilled Quail Wrapped in Pancetta with Sage and Honey ,SautÃ©ed ,Cavolo Nero, ,Fritelle di Riso, with Nocello-soaked Raisins and Banana Gelato ,Olive Oil Gelato ,In the book, Nancy guides you through all the varieties of cheese that she serves at the Mozzarella Bar in the Osteria. And youâ€™ll find all the tricks you need to make homemade pastas, gelato, and pizzas that taste as if they were flown in directly from Italy. Silvertonâ€™s lively and encouraging voice and her comprehensive knowledge of the traditions behind this mouthwateringly decadent cuisine make her recipesâ€”both familiar and intricateâ€”easy to follow and hard to resist. Itâ€™s no wonder it is so difficult to get a table at Mozzaâ€”when youâ€™re cooking these dishes there will be a line out your door as well.","Food and Drink,Cookbooks,Food and Drink,Food,Food and Drink,Cooking,Nonfiction,Reference",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320421716l/10135907.jpg,307272842,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10135907-the-mozza-cookbook,368,The Mozza Cookbook: Recipes from Los Angeles's Favorite Italian Restaurant and Pizzeria,85

James Lileks,Hardcover,"WARNING:,This is not a cookbook. You'll find no tongue-tempting treats within -- unless, of course, you consider Boiled Cow Elbow with Plaid Sauce to be your idea of a tasty meal. No, The Gallery of Regrettable Food is a public service. Learn to identify these dishes. Learn to regard shivering liver molds with suspicion. Learn why curries are a Communist plot to undermine decent, honest American spices. Learn to heed the advice of stern, fictional nutritionists. If you see any of these dishes, please alert the authorities.,Now, the good news: laboratory tests prove that The Gallery of Regrettable Food AMUSES as well as informs. Four out of five doctors recommend this book for its GENEROUS PORTIONS OF HILARITY and ghastly pictures from RETRO COOKBOOKS. You too will look at these products of post-war cuisine and ask: ""WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?"" It's an affectionate look at the days when starch ruled, pepper was a dangerous spice, and Stuffed Meat with Meat Sauce was considered health food.,Bon appetit!,The Gallery of Regrettable Food is a simple introduction to poorly photographed foodstuffs and horrid recipes from the Golden Age of Salt and Starch. It's a wonder anyone in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s gained any weight. It isn't that the food was inedible; it was merely dull. Everything was geared toward a timid palate fearful of spice. It wasn't nonnutritious -- no, between the limp boiled vegetables, fat-choked meat cylinders, and pink whipped Jell-O desserts, you were bound to find a few calories that would drag you into the next day. It's just that the pictures are so hideously unappealing.,Author James Lileks has made it his life's work to unearth the worst recipes and food photography from that bygone era and assemble them with hilarious, acerbic commentary: ""This is not meat. This is something they scraped out of the air filter from the engines of the Exxon Valdez."" It all started when he went home to Fargo and found an ancient recipe book in his mom's cupboard: Specialties of the House, from the North Dakota State Wheat Commission. He never looked back. Now, they're not really recipe books. They're ads for food companies, with every recipe using the company's products, often in unexpected and horrifying ways. There's not a single appetizing dish in the entire collection.,The pictures in the book are ghastly -- the Italian dishes look like a surgeon had a sneezing fit during an operation, and the queasy casseroles look like something on which the janitor dumps sawdust. But you have to enjoy the spirit behind the books -- cheerful postwar perfect housewifery, and folks with the guts to undertake such culinary experiments as stuffing cabbage with hamburger, creating the perfect tongue mousse when you have the fellas over for a pregame nosh, or, best of all, baking peppers with a creamy marshmallow sauce. Alas, too many of these dishes bring back scary childhood memories.","Humor,Food and Drink,Food,Nonfiction,Food and Drink,Cooking,History,Food and Drink,Cookbooks,Culture,Pop Culture,Humor,Comedy,Food and Drink,Childrens,Picture Books",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320544099l/101359.jpg,609607820,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101359.The_Gallery_of_Regrettable_Food,192,The Gallery of Regrettable Food: Highlights from Classic American Recipe Books,131

Geneen Roth,Hardcover,"The #1 New York Times bestselling author of ""Women Food and God"" maps a path to meeting one of our greatest challenges-how we deal with money. When Geneen Roth and her husband lost their life savings in the Bernard Madoff debacle, Roth joined the millions of Americans dealing with financial turbulence, uncertainty, and abrupt reversals in their expectations. The resulting shock was the catalyst for her to explore how women's habits and behaviors around money-as with food-can lead to exactly the situations they most want to avoid. Roth identified her own unconscious choices: binge shopping followed by periods of budgetary self-deprivation, ""treating"" herself in ways that ultimately failed to sustain, and using money as a substitute for love, among others. As she examined the deep sources of these habits, she faced the hard truth about where her ""self-protective"" financial decisions had led. With irreverent humor and hard-won wisdom, she offers provocative and radical strategies for transforming how we feel and behave about the resources that should, and can, sustain and support our lives.","Nonfiction,Self Help,Autobiography,Memoir,Currency,Money,Food and Drink,Food,Health,Psychology,Audiobook,Spirituality,Self Help,Personal Development",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441373850l/10136491._SY475_.jpg,670022713,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10136491-lost-and-found,207,Lost and Found: Unexpected Revelations about Food and Money,31

Jack Kelly,Paperback,"When Chinese alchemists fashioned the first manmade explosion sometime during the tenth century, no one could have foreseen its full revolutionary potential. Invented to frighten evil spirits rather than fuel guns or bombsâ€”neither of which had been thought of yetâ€”their simple mixture of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal went on to make the modern world possible. As word of its explosive properties spread from Asia to Europe, from pyrotechnics to battleships, it paved the way for Western exploration, hastened the end of feudalism and the rise of the nation state, and greased the wheels of the Industrial Revolution.With dramatic immediacy, novelist and journalist Jack Kelly conveys both the distant time in which the ï¿½devilâ€™s distillateâ€ rose to conquer the world, and brings to rousing life the eclectic cast of characters who played a role in its epic story, including Michelangelo, Edward III, Vasco da Gama, CortÃ©s, Guy Fawkes, Alfred Nobel, and E.

Charles A. Riley II,Hardcover,"In the past decade, the mass media discovered disability. Spurred by the box-office appeal of superstars such as the late Christopher Reeve, Michael J. Fox, Stephen Hawking, and others, and given momentum by the success of Oscar-winning movies, popular television shows, best-selling books, and profitable websites, major media corporations have reversed their earlier course of hiding disability, bringing it instead to center stage. Yet depictions of disability have remained largely unchanged since the 1920s. Focusing almost exclusively on the medical aspect of injury or illness, the disability profile in fact and fiction leads inevitably to an inspiring moment of â€œovercoming.â€ According to Riley, this clichÃ© plays well with a general audience, but such narratives, driven by prejudice and pity, highlight the importance of â€œfixingâ€ the disability and rendering the â€œsuffererâ€ as normal as possible. These stories are deeply offensive to persons with disabilities. Equally important, misguided coverage has adverse effects on crucial aspects of public policy, such as employment, social services, and health care. Powerful and influential, the media is complicit in this distortion of disability issues that has proven to be a factor in the economic and social repression of one in five Americans. Newspapers and magazines continue to consign disability stories to the â€œback of the bookâ€ health or human-interest sections, using offensive language that has long been proscribed by activists. Filmmakers compound the problem by featuring angry misfits or poignant heroes of melodramas that pair love and redemption. Publishers churn out self-help titles and memoirs that milk the disability theme for pathos. As Riley points out, all branches of the media are guilty of the same crude distillation of the story to serve their own, usually fiscal, ends. Rileyâ€™s lively inside investigation illuminates the extent of the problem while pinpointing how writers, editors, directors, producers, filmmakers, advertisers and the executives who give their marching orders go wrong, or occasionally get it right. Through a close analysis of the technical means of representation, in conjunction with the commentary of leading voices in the disability community, Riley guides future coverage to a more fair and accurate way of putting the disability story on screen or paper. He argues that with the â€œdiscoveryâ€ by Madison Avenue that the disabled community is a major consumer niche, the economic rationale for more sophisticated coverage is at hand. It is time, says Riley, to cut through the accumulated stereotypes and find an adequate vocabulary that will finally represent the disability community in all its vibrant and fascinating diversity.","Nonfiction,Disability",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348240125l/1013707.jpg,1584654732,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013707.Disability_and_the_Media,284,Disability and the Media: Prescriptions for Change,99

That's easy enough in the summer, when kitchen gardens and allotments are awash with peas, beans, leafy greens, and soft fruit, but not so straightforward in midwinter, when the ground may be frozen solid. Success lies in the planning, and this book is written as a continuum, with sowing, planting, and growing advice for each month to keep the crops coming.,There are also features on harvesting, storing, freezing, and preserving crops to enjoy later in the winter months and the early-spring gap when little is ready to harvest. Advice is given on winter polytunnel and greenhouse crops, and indoor seed sprouting, citrus plants, and herbs in pots to help bring fresh tastes to the table in winter.

They draw on a variety of sources in Latin, Arabic, French, German, Middle English, and more, and employ a range of theories and methodologies, always keeping in mind that environments are inseparable from the making of the people who inhabit them and that these people are in part constituted by and understood in terms of their communities.,Essays feature close readings of both familiar and lesser known materials, offering provocative interpretations of John of Rupescissa's alchemy; the relationship between the living and the saintly dead in Bernard of Clairvaux's sermons; the nomenclature of heresy in the early eleventh century; the apocalyptic visions of Robert of Uzï¿½s; Machiavelli's ,De principatibus,; the role of ""demotic religiosity"" in economic development; and the visions of Elizabeth of Schï¿½nau. Contributors write as historians of religion, art, literature, culture, and society, approaching their subjects through the particular and the singular rather than through the thematic and the theoretical. Playing with the wild possibilities of the historical fragments at their disposal, the scholars in this collection advance a new and exciting approach to writing medieval history.","History,Medieval History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348039843l/1013751.jpg,231133685,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013751.History_in_the_Comic_Mode,392,History in the Comic Mode: Medieval Communities and the Matter of Person,6

Claire L. Wendland,Paperback," ,Burnout is common among doctors in the West, so one might assume that a medical career in Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world, would place far greater strain on the idealism that drives many doctors. But, as ,A Heart for the Work, makes clear, Malawian medical students learn to confront poverty creatively, experiencing fatigue and frustration but also joy and commitment on their way to becoming physicians. The first ethnography of medical training in the global South, Claire L. Wendlandâ€™s book is a moving and perceptive look at medicine in a world where the transnational movement of people and ideas creates both devastation and possibility.,Wendland, a physician anthropologist, conducted extensive interviews and worked in wards, clinics, and operating theaters alongside the student doctors whose stories she relates. From the relative calm of Malawiâ€™s College of Medicine to the turbulence of training at hospitals with gravely ill patients and dramatically inadequate supplies, staff, and technology, Wendlandâ€™s work reveals the way these young doctors engage the contradictions of their circumstances, shedding new light on debates about the effects of medical training, the impact of traditional healing, and the purposes of medicine.","Anthropology,Health,Medicine,Nonfiction,Cultural,Africa,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347937684l/10137617.jpg,226893278,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10137617-a-heart-for-the-work,352,A Heart for the Work: Journeys through an African Medical School,99
William H. Davidow,Hardcover,"In OVERCONNECTED, Bill Davidow explains how the almost miraculous success of the Internet in connecting the world through the Worldwide Web has also created a unique set of hazards, in effect overconnecting us, with the direst of consequences. ,p,The benefits of our recently arrived-at state of connectivity have been myriad from the ease with which it has been possible to buy a new house to the convenience of borrowing and investing money profitably. But the luxuries of the connected age have taken on a momentum all of their own. By counter-intuitively anatomizing how being overconnected tends to create systems of positive feedback that have largely negative consequences, Davidow explains everything from the recent Subprime mortgage crisis to the meltdown of Iceland, from the loss of people s privacy to the spectacular fall of the stock market. All because we were so miraculously wired together.,p,Explaining how such symptoms of Internet connection as unforeseeable accidents and how thought contagions acted to accelerate the downfall and make us permanently vulnerable to catastrophe, Davidow places our recent experience in historical perspective and offers a set of practical steps to minimize similar disasters in the future.p,William Davidow is a successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist, philanthropist, and author, and as a senior vice-president of Intel Corporation, he was responsible for the design of the Intel microprocessor chip.

Elizabeth Hallam,Paperback,"In 987, when Hugh Capet took the throne of France, founding a dynasty which was to rule for over 300 years, his kingdom was weak and insignificant. But by 1100, the kingdom of France was beginning to dominate the cultural nd religious life of western Europe.

Priya Rao left India when she was twenty to study in the U.S., and sheâ€™s never been back. Now, seven years later, sheâ€™s out of excuses.

When she was growing up, summer was all about mangoesâ€”ripe, sweet mangoes, bursting with juices that dripped down your chin, hands, and neck. But after years away, she sweats as if sheâ€™s never been through an Indian summer before. Everything looks dirtier than she remembered. And things that used to seem natural (a buffalo strolling down a newly laid asphalt road, for example) now feel totally chaotic.,But Priyaâ€™s relatives remain the same. Her mother and father insist that itâ€™s time they arranged her marriage to a â€œnice Indian boy.â€ Her extended family talks of nothing but marriageâ€”particularly the marriage of her uncle Anand, which still has them reeling. Not only did Anand marry a woman from another Indian state, but he also married for love. Happiness and love are not the point of her grandparentsâ€™ or her parentsâ€™ union. In her familyâ€™s rule book, duty is at the top of the list.,Just as Priya begins to feel she canâ€™t possibly tell her family that sheâ€™s engaged to an American, a secret is revealed that leaves her stunned and off-balance. Now she is forced to choose between the love of her family and Nick, the love of her life.,As sharp and intoxicating as sugarcane juice bought fresh from a market cart, The Mango Season is a delightful trip into the heart and soul of both contemporary India and a woman on the edge of a profound life change.","Fiction,Contemporary,Cultural,India,Cultural,Asia,Cultural,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Romance,Asian Literature,Indian Literature,Family,Marriage",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320406877l/101384.jpg,345450310,https://goodreads.com/book/show/101384.The_Mango_Season,229,The Mango Season,5

"Simon Houpt,Julian Radcliffe",Hardcover,"Priceless masterpieces...Brazen thefts:,The true story behind the blank spaces on the museum walls.,Â ,Â ,What kind of person would dare to steal a legendary paintingâ€”and who would buy something so instantly recognizable? In recent years, art theft has captured the public imagination more than ever before, spurred by both real life incidents (the snatching of Edvard Munchâ€™s well-known masterwork ,The Scream,) and the glamorous fantasy of such Hollywood films as ,The Thomas Crown Affair,. The truth is, according to INTERPOL records, more than 20,000 stolen works of art are missingâ€”including Rembrandts, Renoirs, van Goghs, and Picassos. ,Museum of the Missing, offers an intriguing tour through the underworld of art theft, where the stakes are high and passions run strong. Not only is the volume beautifully written and lavishly illustratedâ€”if all the paintings presented here could be gathered in one museum it would be one of the finest collections in existenceâ€”it tells a story as fascinating as any crime novel. This gripping page-turner features everything from wartime plundering to audacious modern-day heists, from an examination of the criminalsâ€™ motivations to a look at the professionals who spend their lives hunting down the wrongdoers. Most breathtaking of all, this invaluable resource offers a â€œGallery of Missing Art,â€ an extensive section showcasing stolen paintings that remain lostâ€”including information about the theft and estimated present-day valueâ€”and which may never be seen again.Â ,Â ","Art,Nonfiction,History,Art,Art History,Mystery,Crime,Crime,True Crime,Museology,Museums,Mystery,Historical,History,Microhistory",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328860296l/1013870.jpg,1402728298,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013870.Museum_of_the_Missing,192,Museum of the Missing: A History of Art Theft,106

"Louis Paul Boon,Adrienne Dixon",Paperback,"According to the author, Chapel Road is the book about the childhood of Ondine [. . .] about her brother Valeer-Traleer with his monstrous head wobbling through life this way and that. But the book is about a lot more than that. It is also the story of Louis Paul Boon, an author working on a novel entitled Chapel Road, surrounded by his colorful group of friends. His readers and companions include the painter Tippetotje, who habitually works a naked woman into her paintings, and Johan Janssens, the journalist and poet who is fired from the paper for refusing to agree with the Capitalists, the Socialists or the Ultra-Marxists. Beyond that, Chapel Road includes a retelling of the myth of Reynard the fox and Isengrinus the wolf, a tale that underscores the greed, stupidity, hypocrisy, pride and lust motivating the other characters of the book. Chapel Road is a pool, a sea, a chaos: it is the book of all that can be heard and seen in Chapel Road, from the year 1800-and-something until today.","Fiction,Cultural,Belgium,Literature,Classics,European Literature,Dutch Literature,Roman,Novels,Classics,Modern Classics,Literature,20th Century,European Literature,Belgian",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347796369l/1013883.jpg,1564782859,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1013883.Chapel_Road,338,Chapel Road,20
